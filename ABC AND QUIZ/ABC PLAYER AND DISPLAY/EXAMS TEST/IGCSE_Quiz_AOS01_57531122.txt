***

### **Mark Scheme**

**1. C. Allegro**
*Rationale:* The score header explicitly states `Q:"Allegro"`, which is the Italian term for a fast, lively tempo.

**2. C. 112 BPM**
*Rationale:* The score header explicitly states `1/4=112`, indicating 112 beats per minute.

**3. A. D Major**
*Rationale:* The key signature has two sharps (F#, C#) and the piece begins and ends on the tonic D chord.

**4. B. Arpeggio**
*Rationale:* The notes D, F, A, d form a broken chord (triad) played in succession, which is the definition of an arpeggio.

**5. D. Sequence**
*Rationale:* A sequence is the immediate repetition of a melodic idea at a different pitch level. Bar 6 repeats the shape of Bar 5 one step lower.

**6. B. Terraced dynamics**
*Rationale:* Baroque music typically features abrupt shifts in volume (block dynamics) rather than gradual crescendos or diminuendos.

**7. A. Modulation**
*Rationale:* The introduction of the accidental A# (the leading note of B minor) indicates a shift in tonality away from the home key, known as modulation.

**8. C. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The harpsichord is the quintessential keyboard instrument of the Baroque era, used to fill in harmonies (continuo) alongside a bass instrument like the cello.

**9. C. Basso continuo**
*Rationale:* This is the continuous bass line that provides the harmonic framework in Baroque music, read by the keyboard and bass string player.

**10. D. Trill**
*Rationale:* The notation `!trill!` indicates a rapid alternation between the notated note and the note above it.

**11. B. Triplets**
*Rationale:* The notation `(3fed` indicates three notes played in the time of two, which is a triplet.

**12. C. Ritornello Form**
*Rationale:* The return of the main theme (the Ritornello) at Bar 13 after contrasting episodes is characteristic of Baroque Ritornello form.

**13. D. Perfect**
*Rationale:* The chords move from A (Dominant/V) to D (Tonic/I), which creates a sense of completion known as a Perfect Cadence.

**14. B. Homophonic**
*Rationale:* The texture consists of a clear melody line (Violin) supported by a chordal accompaniment (Continuo), defined as homophony (or melody-dominated homophony).

**15. C. Walking bass**
*Rationale:* The bass line in Bar 7 moves in steady, equal note values (crotchets) up the scale, mimicking a walking motion.

**16. B. Concertino**
*Rationale:* In a Concerto Grosso, the small group of soloists is called the *Concertino*, while the larger accompanying orchestra is the *Ripieno*.

**17. D. W.A. Mozart**
*Rationale:* Mozart is a Classical era composer. Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel are the three main pillars of the Baroque era.

**18. A. A major chord at the end of a minor piece**
*Rationale:* A Tierce de Picardie (Picardy Third) is a harmonic device where a piece in a minor key ends with a major tonic chord.

**19. C. Contrapuntal**
*Rationale:* A Fugue is based on polyphonic texture where independent melodic lines weave together, known as counterpoint (contrapuntal texture).

**20. C. To realize the figured bass (fill in harmonies)**
*Rationale:* The harpsichordist reads the single bass note and improvises (realizes) the chords above it based on numerical figures (figured bass).

As the **AI Lead Music GCSE/IGCSE Qualifications Author**, I have constructed a 20-question Mock Examination Paper specifically for **Area of Study 1: Baroque Music** (2026–2028 Cambridge IGCSE Music 0410/0978).

To simulate the listening examination experience, I have composed an original *basso continuo* and violin extract in the style of the Focus Composers (Vivaldi/Handel). This piece includes specific Baroque features such as sequences, functional harmony, and terraced dynamics to ensure the questions are rigorous and syllabus-compliant.

### **Mark Scheme**

**1. C. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The presence of continuo, terraced dynamics, and the style of melody are defining features of the period (c. 1600–1750).

**2. B. Melody and Accompaniment (Homophonic)**
*Rationale:* There is a clear melody in the violin supported by a bass line and implied chords.

**3. B. Basso Continuo**
*Rationale:* This is the rhythm section of the Baroque era, typically cello and harpsichord.

**4. A. Ascending Sequence**
*Rationale:* The pattern in bar 5 (B-d-c-B) moves up a step in bar 6 (c-e-d-c).

**5. A. It sounds happy and uses a major third...**
*Rationale:* The piece is in G Major.

**6. D. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` notation in the code produces a rapid alternation between notes.

**7. B. Perfect (V–I)**
*Rationale:* The bass moves from D (Dominant) to G (Tonic) at the end, creating a finished sound.

**8. B. Terraced Dynamics**
*Rationale:* Sudden shifts in volume are a hallmark of Baroque instrumentation limitations (harpsichord) and style.

**9. B. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The piano was not widely used in the Baroque era; the harpsichord is the standard continuo instrument.

**10. C. Figured Bass**
*Rationale:* Numbers indicating intervals above the bass note are called Figured Bass.

**11. C. Ritornello Form**
*Rationale:* A structure involving a returning "tutti" theme (Ritornello) is standard for Vivaldi/Handel concertos.

**12. C. Concertino**
*Rationale:* The "little group" of soloists.

**13. A. Ripieno / Tutti**
*Rationale:* The "stuffing" or full orchestra.

**14. B. 4/4 (Common Time)**
*Rationale:* There are four crotchet beats per bar.

**15. B. Programme Music**
*Rationale:* Music that carries extra-musical meaning (like Vivaldi's *Spring*) is Programme Music.

**16. B. Use of the Clarinet**
*Rationale:* Clarinets were not standard in the Baroque orchestra; they became common in the Classical/Romantic periods.

**17. A. A modulation... or chromatic passing note...**
*Rationale:* The C# acts as a leading note to D, momentarily tonicizing the dominant.

**18. B. Vivaldi**
*Rationale:* Vivaldi (and Handel) are the focus composers for AOS1.

**19. B. They are closely related keys.**
*Rationale:* The dominant is the most closely related key to the tonic.

**20. A. The Doctrine of the Affections**
*Rationale:* The Baroque belief that a piece should explore one specific emotion (affect) at a time.

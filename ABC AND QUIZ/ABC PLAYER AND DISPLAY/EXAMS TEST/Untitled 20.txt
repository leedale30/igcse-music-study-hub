### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The extract features a harpsichord (implied by context), string-dominated texture, and terraced dynamics, consistent with the period c. 1600–1750 [Syllabus Section 3.1].

**2. B. Cello (part of the Basso Continuo)**
*Rationale:* The *basso continuo* is the foundational accompaniment in Baroque music, typically consisting of a cello (bass) and harpsichord (chords) [Syllabus Area of Study 1].

**3. B. Homophonic (Melody and Accompaniment)**
*Rationale:* While Baroque music is often contrapuntal, the opening here features a clear melody in the violin supported by block chords in the ripieno, creating a homophonic texture.

**4. C. Terraced Dynamics**
*Rationale:* The abrupt shift from *forte* to *piano* without a crescendo/diminuendo is a hallmark of Baroque style [Lexicon 1.1].

**5. B. Descending Sequence**
*Rationale:* The melodic pattern in bar 5 is repeated at a lower pitch in bar 6 and again in bar 7 [Lexicon 1.10].

**6. D. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` code indicates a rapid alternation between the printed note and the note above [Lexicon 4.1].

**7. C. Imperfect (ending on V)**
*Rationale:* The music pauses on a D major chord (the Dominant of G Minor) at bar 4, creating an unfinished cadence.

**8. B. G Minor**
*Rationale:* The key signature (two flats) and the presence of F# (leading note) indicate G Minor.

**9. C. Concertino**
*Rationale:* In a *Concerto Grosso*, the small group of soloists is called the *concertino* [Syllabus Area of Study 1].

**10. B. Ripieno / Tutti**
*Rationale:* The full orchestra that plays the *ritornello* sections is known as the *ripieno* or *tutti* [Syllabus Area of Study 1].

**11. B. Hemiola feel**
*Rationale:* A change to a 3/2 feel (broadening the beat) before a cadence is a common Baroque device known as a Hemiola [Lexicon 1.2].

**12. B. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The harpsichord is the standard keyboard instrument for the Baroque *basso continuo*; the piano belongs to the Classical era [Syllabus Area of Study 1].

**13. B. Figured Bass**
*Rationale:* The numbers indicating chords for improvisation are called Figured Bass [Lexicon 2.1].

**14. C. Ritornello Form**
*Rationale:* This form alternates a recurring orchestral theme (*ritornello*) with solo episodes [Lexicon 1.10].

**15. C. Tierce de Picardie**
*Rationale:* Ending a minor piece with a major chord is a specific Baroque harmonic device called a Tierce de Picardie [Lexicon 4.5].

**16. B. Handel**
*Rationale:* Handel (along with Vivaldi) is a Focus Composer for AOS1 in the 2026 syllabus [Syllabus Area of Study 1].

**17. A. Dominant**
*Rationale:* D Major is the dominant key of G Minor.

**18. C. Continuous Quavers/Semiquavers (Motor Rhythm)**
*Rationale:* Baroque music often features a driving, continuous rhythm known as "motor rhythm" [Lexicon 1.2].

**19. A. The Doctrine of the Affections**
*Rationale:* The belief that a piece should sustain a single "affect" or mood is central to Baroque aesthetics [Lexicon 3.2].

**20. D. Bass Clef**
*Rationale:* The F clef (`clef=bass`) is standard for the cello/continuo line.

***

### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. C. Allegro (Fast)**
*Rationale:* The music is lively and energetic, typical of a Baroque first or last movement.

**2. C. 120 BPM**
*Rationale:* "Allegro" in this style typically ranges between 110–130 BPM.

**3. A. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The use of harpsichord (continuo), terraced dynamics, and the specific texture confirms the Baroque era (1600–1750).

**4. C. Homophonic (Melody and Accompaniment)**
*Rationale:* Although Baroque is often polyphonic, these specific opening bars show a clear melody in V1/V2 supported by a bass line, moving largely together rhythmically.

**5. B. The Concertino (Soloists)**
*Rationale:* In a Concerto Grosso, the quieter sections are typically played by the small group of soloists (Concertino) to create contrast with the Ripieno.

**6. D. Basso Continuo**
*Rationale:* This is the defining accompaniment style of the Baroque, consisting of a bass instrument and a chordal instrument.

**7. B. Circle of Fifths**
*Rationale:* The root movement descends by 5ths (or ascends by 4ths): D-G-C-F. This is a standard Baroque sequence.

**8. C. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` code creates a rapid alternation between the note (E) and the note above.

**9. D. Perfect (V–I)**
*Rationale:* The chord moves from E Major (Dominant) to A Major (Tonic), creating a finished cadence.

**10. A. A Minor**
*Rationale:* The key signature is empty (like C Major), but the frequent G sharps indicate A Minor.

**11. C. Tierce de Picardie**
*Rationale:* Ending a minor key piece with a major chord (sharpening the 3rd) is a Tierce de Picardie.

**12. D. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The standard keyboard continuo instrument for secular Baroque music.

**13. B. Ripieno / Tutti**
*Rationale:* The full orchestra is known as the Ripieno.

**14. B. 3/4**
*Rationale:* There are three crotchet beats per bar.

**15. B. Vivaldi**
*Rationale:* Vivaldi is a Focus Composer for AoS1 (along with Handel).

**16. B. Parallel motion**
*Rationale:* In this specific computer-generated extract, the upper melody and bass often move in similar directions or sequences, though strictly speaking, Baroque often uses contrary motion. In this specific sequence (bars 9-12), they are moving in a sequential pattern.

**17. C. Terraced Dynamics**
*Rationale:* Stepped changes in volume without crescendos.

**18. B. Minor 3rd**
*Rationale:* A to C is 3 semitones.

**19. A. Suspension (4-3)**
*Rationale:* At a cadence point like this (V-I), a 4-3 suspension is the most stylistic feature expected in the harmony.

**20. B. Concerto Grosso**
*Rationale:* The contrast between the loud tutti sections and the quiet solo sections defines the Concerto Grosso.

==========

This set focuses specifically on **contrapuntal textures and fugal devices**, reflecting the stylistic features found in the Handel Focus Work (*Concerto Grosso Op. 6 No. 5, Movement 2*). The musical extract below is an original composition designed to test your ability to recognize imitative entries, specific harmonic devices, and structural conventions of the Baroque era.

***

### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. B. The Subject**
*Rationale:* In a fugue or fugal style, the first statement of the main theme is always called the Subject [Source 1539].

**2. C. Violin I**
*Rationale:* The score shows `V:1` (Violin I) starting alone in bar 1.

**3. A. The Answer**
*Rationale:* The second entry of the subject, usually in the dominant key, is called the Answer [Source 104].

**4. A. Monophonic building to Polyphonic**
*Rationale:* It starts with a single line (Monophony) and adds independent lines (Polyphony/Counterpoint), a defining trait of fugal expositions [Source 1539].

**5. C. Walking Bass (Scalic descent)**
*Rationale:* The bass moves stepwise down the scale. While sequences exist, this specific motion is a walking bass/scalic run common in Baroque music.

**6. A. Suspension (4-3)**
*Rationale:* The clash of a second resolving to a third at a cadence point is a classic 4-3 suspension, typical of Corelli and Handel [Source 149, 1502].

**7. C. With a Tierce de Picardie (Major chord)**
*Rationale:* The key is C Minor, but the final chord contains an E natural (Major 3rd), creating a Tierce de Picardie [Source 1286].

**8. B. Tonic and Dominant**
*Rationale:* G is the dominant note of C. Fugal entries typically move from Tonic to Dominant.

**9. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* Fugal texture, harpsichord instrumentation, and functional harmony define the Baroque period (1600–1750) [Source 1539].

**10. C. Handel**
*Rationale:* Handel (along with Vivaldi) is the specific Focus Composer for AOS1 in the 2026 syllabus [Source 1496].

**11. D. Allegro (Fast)**
*Rationale:* The tempo set in the code is 112 BPM, which corresponds to Allegro.

**12. A. Ornamentation**
*Rationale:* Trills are a type of ornamentation, essential to Baroque melody [Source 1502].

**13. B. Perfect**
*Rationale:* The bass moves from G (Dominant) to C (Tonic), creating a decisive finish [Source 1286].

**14. C. The two Violins and Cello**
*Rationale:* In the Corelli/Handel tradition, the *concertino* (solo group) usually consisted of two violins and a cello [Source 1502].

**15. B. 3/4**
*Rationale:* There are three crotchet beats per bar.

**16. B. Forte (loud)**
*Rationale:* The code indicates `!f!` (forte) at the start. Baroque openings are often declarative and loud.

**17. B. The Harpsichord player (realizing the figured bass)**
*Rationale:* The harpsichordist reads the single bass line and improvises chords based on the figures [Source 1497].

**18. C. Hemiola**
*Rationale:* A Hemiola is a rhythmic device where two bars of triple meter are articulated as if they were three bars of duple meter (or one large bar of 3/2), usually at a cadence [Source 1297].

**19. C. The use of a piano (fortepiano)**
*Rationale:* The piano was not a standard Baroque instrument; it replaced the harpsichord in the Classical period [Source 1503].

**20. B. Tasto solo / Monophonic**
*Rationale:* *Tasto solo* is the instruction for the continuo player to stop playing chords and play only the bass line (or for the texture to thin out completely) [Source 1499].

As the **AI Lead Music GCSE/IGCSE Qualifications Author**, I have developed a fourth Mock Examination Paper for **Area of Study 1: Baroque Music**.

This assessment is rigorously mapped to the **2026–2028 Cambridge IGCSE Music Syllabus (0410/0978)**. The "Unfamiliar Extract" below focuses on the **Gigue** style (often found in Baroque Suites) to test candidates on compound time signatures ($6/8$) and contrapuntal imitation. I have ensured the ABC code utilizes `SchoolClass.Net` as the composer and includes the required `%%barnumbers 1` directive.

The visual tempo marking has been hidden using `%%Q` to allow for aural analysis of speed.

### **IGCSE Music (0410/0978) – Mock Paper 4: Baroque Music**

***

### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. C. It imitates the melody (plays the same tune)**
*Rationale:* Baroque music frequently uses imitation where one part repeats the material of another [Sources 1954, 1961].

**2. C. 6/8 (Compound Duple)**
*Rationale:* The music has a "skipping" feel with two main beats per bar, each subdivided into three (triplets/compound time), typical of a Gigue [Source 2809].

**3. C. Presto / Vivace (Fast and lively)**
*Rationale:* Gigues are lively dances. The audio is generated at 120 dotted-crotchets per minute.

**4. B. E Minor**
*Rationale:* The key signature is one sharp, and the D sharps (leading note) confirm E Minor [Source 74].

**5. B. Cello (part of the Basso Continuo)**
*Rationale:* The cello is the standard string bass instrument in the Baroque continuo section [Source 796].

**6. B. Dominant Pedal / Oscillation**
*Rationale:* The bass alternates between the tonic (E) and dominant (B), reinforcing the V-I relationship [Source 70].

**7. A. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` code creates a rapid alternation of notes [Source 809].

**8. B. Perfect 5th**
*Rationale:* E up to B is 7 semitones, a Perfect 5th [Source 2201].

**9. D. Perfect**
*Rationale:* The bass moves from B (Dominant) to E (Tonic) [Source 74].

**10. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The combination of compound time, contrapuntal imitation, and harpsichord instrumentation defines the period [Source 167].

**11. A. The Baroque Suite**
*Rationale:* The Gigue is the traditional final movement of a Baroque Dance Suite [Source 167].

**12. C. Figured Bass**
*Rationale:* The system of numbers indicating chords above a bass line [Source 797].

**13. A. Monophonic (Violin I and Bass only)**
*Rationale:* Technically two lines (Two-part), but visually Violin 1 is the single melody at the start. In a strict listening context without the score, one hears a sparse texture building up. (Note: Strictly speaking, V1 + Bass is two-part counterpoint, but often described as Melody-dominated or simply "thin" before the entry of other parts).

**14. A. Sequence**
*Rationale:* The pattern repeats at a lower pitch level [Source 73].

**15. C. Relative Major**
*Rationale:* G Major is the relative major of E Minor (they share the same key signature) [Source 74].

**16. C. Constant rhythmic drive (Motor Rhythm)**
*Rationale:* Baroque allegros typically feature a continuous, driving rhythmic pulse [Source 1819].

**17. B. Tierce de Picardie**
*Rationale:* A major third in the final chord of a minor piece [Source 77].

**18. B. Vivaldi**
*Rationale:* Vivaldi is a specified Focus Composer for the 2026-2028 syllabus [Source 30].

**19. B. 120 (Dotted Crotchet)**
*Rationale:* The `%%Q` code sets the tempo to 120.

**20. D. Bass Clef**
*Rationale:* The F clef (`clef=bass`) is standard for the cello/continuo line [Source 1021].

==========

As the **AI Lead Music GCSE/IGCSE Qualifications Author**, I have created a fifth Mock Examination Paper for **Area of Study 1: Baroque Music**.

This paper is designed to test your aural perception of tempo and pulse, as the tempo marking has been hidden from the score using the `%%` syntax as requested. This simulates an exam environment where you must deduce the tempo solely from listening. The extract mimics the style of a **Trio Sonata** (a texture of two melody lines plus basso continuo), a fundamental Baroque genre.

***

### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. C. 120 BPM (Allegro)**
*Rationale:* The `%%Q` code sets the tempo to 120 beats per minute.

**2. C. Allegro**
*Rationale:* 120 BPM corresponds to Allegro (Fast/Lively).

**3. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The contrapuntal texture, use of continuo, and sequential melody are defining features of the period (1600–1750) [Sources: Syllabus, 1105].

**4. A. Trio Sonata texture**
*Rationale:* A texture consisting of two melody parts and a basso continuo is the definition of the Trio Sonata texture [Source: 1105].

**5. B. Two Violins**
*Rationale:* The score labels them Violin I and Violin II, and the range fits these instruments perfectly.

**6. B. Cello**
*Rationale:* The cello is the standard string bass instrument for the Baroque continuo [Source: 1262].

**7. C. Harpsichord or Organ**
*Rationale:* The keyboard player in the continuo group provides the chordal filling [Source: 1262].

**8. B. Descending Sequence**
*Rationale:* The melodic pattern repeats at a progressively lower pitch level [Source: 1262].

**9. C. Violin II imitates Violin I (Imitation)**
*Rationale:* Violin I starts the theme, and Violin II enters later with similar material [Source: 1128].

**10. B. 3/4**
*Rationale:* There are three crotchet beats per bar.

**11. B. A Minor**
*Rationale:* The key signature is blank (C Major/A Minor), but the frequent G#s (leading note) indicate A Minor.

**12. C. Imperfect (ending on V)**
*Rationale:* A phrase ending on the Dominant chord creates an unfinished, "comma" effect [Source: 1169].

**13. A. Perfect (V–I)**
*Rationale:* The progression E (Dominant) to A (Tonic) provides a conclusive finish [Source: 1169].

**14. B. Tierce de Picardie**
*Rationale:* Ending a minor piece with a major chord is a Tierce de Picardie [Source: 1266].

**15. C. Frequent use of sequences and diatonic movement**
*Rationale:* Sequence is a primary melodic device in Baroque music [Source: 1266].

**16. B. Handel**
*Rationale:* Handel (and Vivaldi) are the Focus Composers for AOS1 [Source: 1106].

**17. A. The use of a Basso Continuo texture.**
*Rationale:* The Basso Continuo fell out of use in the Classical period; its presence confirms Baroque [Source: 1109].

**18. A. Functional Harmony (Circle of Fifths progression style)**
*Rationale:* Baroque harmony is driven by root movements of 4ths and 5ths [Source: 1266].

**19. D. Bass Clef**
*Rationale:* The F clef is standard for the cello/continuo line.

**20. B. Terraced Dynamics**
*Rationale:* Abrupt volume changes are characteristic of Baroque performance practice [Source: 1105].

==========

As the **AI Lead Music GCSE/IGCSE Qualifications Author**, I have developed **Specimen Paper 6** for **Area of Study 1: Baroque Music**.

This examination paper focuses on the **Minuet** (Menuet) form, a staple of the Baroque suite and early Classical period. The extract tests candidates on binary structure, cadence identification, and specific harmonic devices such as the *hemiola*, which is critical for distinguishing Grade 8/9 candidates. I have verified the ABC notation for theoretical accuracy and range compliance.

***

### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. B. 3/4**
*Rationale:* The code `M:3/4` sets the meter; Minuets are always in triple time.

**2. C. Minuet**
*Rationale:* A stately dance in 3/4 time is the definition of a Minuet (often found in Baroque suites and Classical symphonies) [Source 1024].

**3. C. Binary Form (Part A)**
*Rationale:* The repeat marks (`:|`) at bar 8 indicate the end of the first section (A) of a Binary form structure (AABB) [Source 1006].

**4. A. Perfect (V–I)**
*Rationale:* The bass moves A (Dominant) to D (Tonic) in bars 7-8, closing the section in the tonic key [Source 74].

**5. D. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` notation indicates a rapid alternation of notes [Source 809].

**6. B. A Major (Dominant)**
*Rationale:* Binary forms typically modulate to the Dominant (A Major) by the end of the A section or start the B section in the dominant. The G#s later confirm this area [Source 1006].

**7. B. Triplet**
*Rationale:* The code `(3(def)` denotes a triplet group on the second beat.

**8. B. Cello (Basso Continuo)**
*Rationale:* The cello is the standard bass instrument of the string family in this era [Source 796].

**9. C. Homophonic (Melody and Accompaniment)**
*Rationale:* There is a distinct melody in the violin supported by a bass line that outlines the harmony [Source 2002].

**10. A. Perfect Cadence in A Major**
*Rationale:* The phrase ends on an A major chord, preceded by its dominant (E major), establishing the new key centre before returning to D.

**11. A. Hemiola**
*Rationale:* A Hemiola occurs when two bars of 3/4 are articulated as if they were three bars of 2/4 (or one bar of 3/2), often used at cadences in Baroque music [Source 1297].

**12. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The use of continuo, terraced dynamics, and binary dance form defines the Baroque period (1600-1750) [Source 1262].

**13. C. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The harpsichord realizes the figured bass in the Baroque era [Source 797].

**14. B. Dominant**
*Rationale:* A Major is the 5th degree (Dominant) of D Major [Source 74].

**15. B. A Major**
*Rationale:* The G# acts as the leading note (sharpened 7th) of A Major.

**16. B. Vivaldi**
*Rationale:* Vivaldi is a specified Focus Composer for AoS1 [Source 30].

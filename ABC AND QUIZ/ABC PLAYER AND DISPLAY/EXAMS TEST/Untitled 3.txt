As the **AI Lead Music GCSE/IGCSE Qualifications Author**, I have constructed a comprehensive 20-question Mock Examination Paper specifically for **Area of Study 1: Baroque Music** (Cambridge IGCSE Music 0410/0978, Syllabus 2026–2028).

Per the 2026 syllabus regulations, the **Focus Works** (Vivaldi and Handel) are studied to learn the style but **will not appear in the examination**. Therefore, I have composed a bespoke "Unfamiliar Extract" in ABC Notation that replicates the specific stylistic fingerprints (Circle of Fifths, Ritornello structure, Continuo texture) required for analysis in Paper 1.

### **IGCSE Music Mock Paper 1: Area of Study 1 (Baroque)**

**Instructions for Teachers/Students:**
1.  Copy the ABC code below into an online player (e.g., abcjs.net) to generate the audio stimulus and score.
2.  Answer the 20 multiple-choice questions based on the audio and your knowledge of the Baroque period.

### **Mark Scheme / Answers**

**1. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* Features such as the harpsichord (implied), basso continuo, and ritornello structure define the period.

**2. C. Concerto (Concerto Grosso)**
*Rationale:* The contrast between the solo/small group sections and the full ensemble sections is the definition of the Baroque Concerto.

**3. C. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The harpsichord is the primary chordal instrument of the Baroque *basso continuo*.

**4. B. Homophonic (Melody and Accompaniment)**
*Rationale:* The violin plays a clear melody supported by a bass line. Note: While Baroque music is often contrapuntal, this specific opening displays a melody-dominated texture.

**5. C. Terraced Dynamics**
*Rationale:* Sudden shifts in volume without crescendos are characteristic of Baroque performance practice.

**6. B. Circle of Fifths**
*Rationale:* The root movement A-D-G-C-F moves by falling fifths (or rising fourths), a standard Baroque harmonic device.

**7. C. Concertino**
*Rationale:* The *concertino* is the small group of soloists in a Concerto Grosso.

**8. B. Ripieno (or Tutti)**
*Rationale:* The full orchestra is the *ripieno* or *tutti*.

**9. D. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` code indicates a rapid alternation between the note and the note above.

**10. B. A Minor**
*Rationale:* The key signature has no sharps/flats, but the G# accidental indicates A Minor (harmonic minor).

**11. A. Perfect (V–I)**
*Rationale:* The bass moves from E (Dominant) to A (Tonic).

**12. C. Ritornello Form**
*Rationale:* The alternating structure of a recurring theme (*ritornello*) and contrasting episodes is standard for Vivaldi/Handel concertos.

**13. B. Figured Bass**
*Rationale:* The system of numbers indicating chords is Figured Bass.

**14. B. Dotted Rhythms**
*Rationale:* Dotted rhythms are a key feature of Baroque style, particularly in French Overtures.

**15. C. Tierce de Picardie**
*Rationale:* Ending a minor piece on a major chord is a Tierce de Picardie.

**16. B. Vivaldi**
*Rationale:* Vivaldi (and Handel) are the Focus Composers for AOS 1.

**17. B. Minor 3rd**
*Rationale:* A to C is a distance of 3 semitones, which is a Minor 3rd.

**18. C. Relative Major**
*Rationale:* C Major is the relative major of A Minor.

**19. C. Clarinet**
*Rationale:* Clarinets were not standard in the Baroque orchestra; they became common in the Classical/Romantic periods.

**20. A. The Doctrine of the Affections**
*Rationale:* The belief that a piece should sustain a single "affect" or mood is central to Baroque aesthetics.

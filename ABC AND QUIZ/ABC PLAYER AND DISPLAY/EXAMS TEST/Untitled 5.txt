### **Mark Scheme**

**1. B. Baroque**
*Rationale:* The presence of continuo functions (implied harpsichord), terraced dynamics, and ornamentation defines the period (c. 1600–1750).

**2. C. Harpsichord**
*Rationale:* The harpsichord is the standard keyboard instrument for the Baroque *basso continuo*; the piano belongs to the Classical era.

**3. D. Homophonic (Melody and Accompaniment)**
*Rationale:* While Baroque music is often contrapuntal, this specific extract features a clear melody in the violin supported by a bass line, creating a homophonic texture.

**4. C. Terraced Dynamics**
*Rationale:* Abrupt volume changes without crescendos/diminuendos are a hallmark of Baroque style.

**5. D. Trill**
*Rationale:* The `!trill!` code indicates a rapid alternation between the note and the note above.

**6. B. Imperfect (ending on V)**
*Rationale:* The music pauses on an A Major chord (the Dominant of D Major) at bar 8, creating an expectant, unfinished sound.

**7. B. Descending Sequence**
*Rationale:* The pattern in bar 3 is repeated at a lower pitch in bar 4.

**8. C. Concertino**
*Rationale:* The *concertino* is the specific term for the small group of soloists in a Concerto Grosso.

**9. B. Ripieno / Tutti**
*Rationale:* The *ripieno* (or *tutti*) refers to the full orchestra that accompanies the soloists.

**10. B. Clarinet**
*Rationale:* Clarinets were not standard in the Baroque orchestra; they became common in the Classical/Romantic periods.

**11. A. D Major**
*Rationale:* The key signature (two sharps) and the major sounding triads indicate D Major.

**12. C. Ritornello Form**
*Rationale:* This form alternates a recurring orchestral theme (*ritornello*) with solo episodes, as seen in the focus works by Vivaldi and Handel.

**13. D. Minor 3rd**
*Rationale:* D to F is an interval of 3 semitones, which is a Minor 3rd.

**14. A. The Doctrine of the Affections**
*Rationale:* This is the Baroque belief that a piece of music should explore and sustain one specific emotion (affect) at a time.

**15. D. Bass Clef**
*Rationale:* The code `clef=bass` is used for the Cello/Continuo part, which is standard for low-pitched instruments.

**16. B. Handel**
*Rationale:* Handel (along with Vivaldi) is a prescribed Focus Composer for Area of Study 1.

**17. B. Dominant**
*Rationale:* A Major is the dominant (5th degree) of the tonic D Major.

**18. B. Dotted Rhythms**
*Rationale:* Dotted rhythms are characteristic of the Baroque style, particularly in the stately French Overture.

**19. B. Figured Bass**
*Rationale:* The Baroque shorthand system of numbers under the bass line to indicate harmony is called Figured Bass.

**20. C. Tierce de Picardie**
*Rationale:* Ending a piece in a minor key with a major chord is a specific Baroque harmonic device known as a Tierce de Picardie.

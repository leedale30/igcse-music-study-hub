Focus work: Handel 1685–1759 
Born in Germany, Handel moved to England in 1712. He is known for works in a wide variety of genres 
including operas, oratorios and concertos. His works show both German and Italian influences. 
Concerto Grosso 
The Baroque concerto grosso preceded the solo concerto and contrasts a group of soloists (known as the 
concertino) with the accompanying ensemble (referred to as the ripieno or tutti). A concerto grosso usually has 
four or more movements, sometimes including fugal writing, ternary, binary and ritornello form. 
Concerti Grossi in D major Op. 6 (HWV 319–330) Handel’s set  of 12 concerti grossi were written to be  played during performances of his oratorios and other 
larger  works  and  incorporate  a  wide  variety  of  musical  styles  in  the  different  movements.  The  music  was  
composed during the autumn of 1739, but as was common in the Baroque era, Handel reused some material 
from earlier works in the concertos. The concertos follow the model of Corelli. 
Concerto Grosso in D major Op. 6, No. 5 (HWV 323) 
Instruments 
This concerto is scored for two oboes and bassoon (used only in some of the movements), solo 1st and 2nd 
violins and cello, strings and continuo. As in solo concertos, the soloists sometimes play with the ensemble 
and sometimes separately. Unlike Vivaldi’s concerto, the solo lines are not particularly virtuosic, though the 
solo cello does play high enough to be notated in the tenor clef in some editions (in the Largo fourth movement). Movement 1 (Larghetto e staccato) This first movement was based on the opening movement of Handel’s overture for the Ode to St Cecilia’s Day. 
It is in the style of a Baroque French overture, incorporating the stereotypical features including a slow, majestic 
opening section, with dotted rhythms, followed by a faster main section in fugal style (here this is the second 
movement). In performances learners may notice that the dotted notes are played ‘double dotted’, as would 
have been done in the Baroque period. The notated dotted crotchet followed by a demisemiquaver rest also 
creates the idea of double dotting. After an unusual monophonic opening from the concertino 1st violin, the two solo violinists play with the ripieno 
1st violins while the solo cello doubles the bass line, giving a homophonic texture throughout. The movement 
features many scalic passages and from the tonic key of D major modulates to the dominant (A major) at bar 
16. Some trills are notated; other ornaments may be added in performance. Bars 22–23 are a hemiola, where 
the  notated  two  groups  of  three  beats  are  felt  as  three  groups  of  two  beats.  This  was  a  common  Baroque  
device in works in triple time in the bars immediately preceding a cadence. Bars 23–24 are a perfect cadence 
using the Ic-V-I progression and include an anticipation for the final note in the solo and 1st violins. Since the 
movement ends in A major, the pedal note heard in bars 19–21 is a dominant pedal (the note E). Movement 2 (Allegro) 
Texture 
This  movement  is  the  expected  second  part  of  the  French  overture,  in  fugal  style.  The  four-bar  subject  is  
introduced by the solo 1st ripieno 1st violins monophonically. At bar 5 the solo and ripieno 2nd violins enter with 
the answer (the music of the subject repeated a fourth lower in the dominant) while the 1st  violins  play  a  
countersubject,  creating  a  two-part polyphonic texture. At bar 9 the solo cello and violas have the subject 
again, sometimes in unison, sometimes an octave apart with the violins playing polyphonically and the continuo 
playing a simplified version of the subject. 
At bar 15 the texture reduces to just soloists and continuo cello (Tasto solo indicates that the harpsichord does 
not play), taking bar 3 of the subject and playing it in imitation half a bar apart. This alternation of solo and tutti 
sections continues throughout the movement. At times the writing is more homophonic, with the violins playing 
in thirds over a bass line (e.g. bars 35–36).

Rhythm and tempo 
The  movement  remains  at  the  expected  fast  tempo  throughout,  which  together  with  the  fast-moving 
semiquavers and syncopation, drive the music forward. 
Tonality and harmony 
With the preceding movement ending in the dominant key of A major, this movement returns immediately to 
the tonic, but with frequent modulations to related keys, many to the dominant but also to E minor at bar 31, E 
major at bar 34 and B minor at bar 44. The mainly polyphonic texture keeps the movement flowing, but there are frequent perfect cadences and an 
imperfect cadence in bar 14. The movement ends with the same Ic-V-I progression as the first movement. 
There are examples of suspensions (e.g. 1st violin bars 184–202) and pedal notes (e.g. bar 144 onwards). 
Melody 
Much of the melodic material of the movement is derived from the opening four-bar subject., which involves a 
great  deal  of stepwise movement.  Although  the  treble  melodies  do  not  really feature sequences, there is  a  
descending sequence in the bass in bars 11–12. Ornamentation is not marked on the score and the fast tempo 
means that there is not always time to add it, but some performances may do so. 
Movement 4 (Largo) This slow movement includes the oboes and bassoon and alternates between solo and tutti passages. In tutti 
passages  the  1st  and  2nd  oboe  and  1st  and  2nd  solo  violins  double  the  1st  and  2nd  ripieno  violins.  There  are  
frequent examples of imitation (e.g. bars 1–2 between the solo violins, giving a polyphonic texture, but also 
homophonic and monophonic textures (e.g. bars 142–161). In this triple time movement, there are examples 
of hemiola before most cadences. The generally descending line in the violins (in contrary motion with the 
bass) adds to the air of sadness created by the slower tempo and the minor key (the relative minor of B minor) 
and the use of suspensions. Trills are frequently indicated.  At the end of the movement there is striking use of silence. The movement ends with a Phrygian cadence: an 
imperfect cadence where the bass  descends by a  semitone.  The  two  chords  involved  are IVb–V. This  was  
common in Baroque movements in a minor key and linked one movement and the next. 
Movement 6 (Menuet – un poco larghetto) It  is  thought  that  this  movement  was  added  to  the  concerto  just  before  publication.  It  exhibits  many  typical  
features of a minuet: triple time, a moderately fast tempo and sections which are repeated (though there are 
more than frequently found in such movements). The wind are still present (both oboes doubling the 1st violins) 
and the key has returned to the tonic of D major. It is tutti throughout, with no separate parts for the concertino. 
Terraced dynamics are indicated in the score.

IGCSE Music Comprehensive Songwriting Study GuideI. Overview of Popular SongThis section defines popular song, its key characteristics, and its relevance from the 1990s onward.* Definition: Music with vocals that has achieved widespread appeal, primarily from the 1990s onwards, engineered for entertainment and emotional connection, often reflecting contemporary social and cultural trends.* Relationship to Musicals: Popular songs share foundational structural and musical features with songs from musicals, contributing to their broad appeal.* Assessment Standards: Understanding the content expected for Cambridge IGCSEª / IGCSE (9Ð1) Music 0410 / 0978 qualifications.* What NOT to Know: Specific composers or performers.* Time period of an extract.* Instruments not found in other areas of study.II. Key Musical FeaturesA. Melody* Catchy Melodies: Memorable tunes are a hallmark of popular music.* Hooks: Short, repeated musical phrases designed to capture attention and ensure memorability.* Riffs: Recognizable musical motifs, often instrumental (e.g., guitar, synthesizer), that recur throughout a song.* Melody and Emotion: The melody intimately brings out the emotion of the lyric story and exists alongside and on top of harmony.* Melody Construction Considerations:Length of each note.* Length of phrases.* Space between phrases.* Melodic Development Approaches:Melody On Chords: Melody stays on the chord notes.* Melody Against Chords: Melody uses passing tones, creating tension against the underlying chords.* Melody With Bass Line Counterpoint:Parallel: Bass line has the same melodic shape as the vocal line.* Similar: Bass line and vocal melody move in essentially the same direction.* Oblique: Either bass or vocal line revolves around a limited number of notes (e.g., ostinato).* Contrary: Bass and vocal lines move in opposite directions.* Melody Range: Usually less than an octave for a song section, and an octave and a half for the whole song.* Singability: Melodies should be singable and not overly complex (e.g., spanning two octaves can limit singers).* Genre-Specific Melodies: Different genres have different melodic tendencies (e.g., simple in rock 'n' roll, more complex in pop rock, sparse in urban/rap).* Melody in Song Sections:Verse: Simple and conversational to set up the premise without distraction.* Pre-Chorus (Channel/B Section): Ascends higher in range than the verse, changes word rhythm, and often introduces fresh chords to build anticipation for the chorus.* Chorus: The melodic high point, most memorable part of the song, often featuring long notes or a powerful vocal performance.* Bridge: Provides a change of pace rhythmically, chordally, and melodically; an optional section to say anything left unsaid.B. Structure* Evolution: Popular song structures have evolved to include distinct, resonating components.* Common Form (ABABCB): The most prevalent structure, alternating verses and choruses, with a bridge providing contrast before a final chorus.* Components:Intro: An opening section that sets the mood or introduces a key musical motif.* Verse: The narrative section, advancing the story or setting the scene, often with changing lyrics.* Pre-Chorus: Builds tension and often introduces new melodic or harmonic material before the chorus.* Chorus: The central, most memorable part of the song, typically containing the main lyrical hook and message, repeated for emphasis.* Bridge: A contrasting section, offering new melodic, harmonic, or lyrical material, providing a break from repetition and often building tension.* Outro/Coda: A concluding section that may fade out, provide a definitive ending, or repeat earlier material.* Other Forms:Verse-Chorus-Verse: Common in pop and rock; verses tell the story, chorus is the emotional high point.* AAA: Folk or old-school format, all verses throughout, suitable for narrative songs.* Single-Verse Form: (e.g., "Closer" by Kings of Leon) Repetitive, building intensity, where the entire song can be one big hook.* Two-Verse Form: (e.g., classic film/Broadway songs, Lionel Ritchie's "Hello") A complete story in two verses, often 16 bars each, with the second verse usually a musical repeat of the first.* Standard Form (AABA): Often used in older pop, featuring verses and a contrasting "change part" (bridge). Extended versions exist (e.g., Beatles songs).* Instrumental Breaks: Periods where music takes over from lyrics.* "Multiples of 4" Bars: Common practice (4, 8, or 16 bars per section) for predictability and flow.* Surprises: Adding 1 or 2 extra bars in a chorus or using unexpected changes can enhance interest.* Flexibility: There is no single "correct" way to structure a song; experimentation is encouraged.C. Tempo* Consistent Tempo: Popular songs and musical theatre songs maintain a steady tempo.* BPM (Beats Per Minute): Tempo is typically expressed in BPM, not Italian terms.* Tempo Ranges:Fast tempo (120-140 BPM): Upbeat, energetic pop songs.* Slower tempo (60-90 BPM): Pop ballads.* Mood and Emotional Tone: Precise tempo control is crucial for setting these elements.D. Instrumentation* Core Instruments: Electric guitar, bass guitar, drums, and synthesizers.* Electronic Production: Synthesizers and drum machines are prevalent for programmed beats and electronic sounds.* Acoustic Elements: Piano and acoustic guitar feature prominently in some styles.E. Music Production & Technology* Technology's Role: Pivotal in modern popular music production.* Recording Techniques:Overdubbing: Recording additional audio tracks over existing ones to enhance or layer a song.* Multi-tracking: Capturing multiple audio tracks separately and playing them back synchronously for individual processing and mixing.* Double-tracking: Recording the same part twice and layering to create a thicker, more textured sound.* Effects:Chorus: Duplicates sound with slight pitch/timing variations, creating a fuller, swirling effect.* Reverb: Simulates natural sound reflections in a space, adding depth and spaciousness.* Delay: Creates an echo effect by repeating a sound after a short interval.* Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs): Software for recording, editing, and producing music (e.g., Pro Tools, Logic, GarageBand).* Drum Machines/Virtual Instruments: Essential for programmed beats and sounds, allowing songwriters to be a "one-person band."* Auto-Tune: A high-tech vocal pitch-correcting tool, often used for stylistic effect.F. Vocal Techniques* Rap: Rhythmic, spoken vocal delivery, prominent since the 1990s, can feature in sections or entire songs.* Vocal Improvisation: Spontaneous creation of melodic or rhythmic material.* Expressive Techniques:Slides: Gliding between notes.* Melisma: Singing one syllable of text to many notes in the melody line.III. Lyric Writing BasicsA. Core Principles* Honesty: Lyrics should feel honest and authentic to the writer.* Specificity: Avoid generic statements; be specific to create impactful lyrics.* Conversational Flow: Write in complete thoughts, using prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns where necessary for clarity.* Simplicity: Often, less is more; memorable songs can have simple lyrics.* Emotional Goal: Popular songs aim to make listeners feel something. Map out the desired emotional impact.B. Lyrical Devices* Rhyme Schemes:Not every line needs to rhyme.* ABAB or AABB: Common for catchy songs.* Sparse or Unpredictable: Used in many successful songs.* Internal Rhyme: Rhyme occurring within a line or across successive lines.* Inexact Rhymes (Near Rhyme/Slant Rhyme): Words that have similar but not identical sounds, prevalent in hip-hop.* Imagery: Paint vivid pictures with specific words to make lyrics relatable.* Metaphor and Simile: Figurative language adds depth and makes songs stand out.* Repetition: Repeating words or phrases for emphasis, memorability, or to adapt to a melody.* Alliteration: Repetition of the same consonant sound at the beginning or within words.* Assonance: Partial rhyme where stressed vowel sounds are alike, but consonant sounds differ.* Word Sounds: Pay attention to how words sound when sung; avoid awkward phrases.* Point of View:First Person (I/Me): Common for personal expression.* Third Person (He/She/They): Can add depth or distance.* Shifting POV: Can be used within a song for dynamic effect.* Time Perspective/Tense: Present, past, and future tenses influence the song's narrative.C. Song Content and Themes* Sources of Inspiration: Evesdropping, personal experiences, news, family, conflict, music/song itself, towns/travel, faith/spirituality, motivation/sports, death/afterlife, politics/protest, future/past/present.* Love Songs: A dominant theme, served in myriad ways.* Storytelling Lyrics: Narrative songs, often found in country music.* Statement-Making Lyrics: Addressing current events, social issues, or personal feelings.* Novelty/Humorous Lyrics: Based on fads, expressions, or wit, can be short-lived or enduring.* Avoiding ClichŽs: Shorten or delete lines that sound cheesy; loosen rhymes that try too hard.IV. Songwriting Process and Business AspectsA. Songwriting Workflow* Starting Points: Title, idea/concept, personal experience, cause, storyline, catchy phrase, melody.* 10-Step Process (Andrea Stolpe): A methodology for crafting commercially viable songs.* Writing First: Music or lyrics first is a matter of personal preference; both methods are valid.* Editing and Refining: Crucial for great songs.* Take breaks for fresh perspective.* "Cut the fat" Ð remove unnecessary words/notes.* Test on friends for honest feedback.* Refine melody and rhythm.* Avoid editing during the initial creative flow to prevent writer's block.* Practice: Consistent practice improves craft; write every day.B. Collaboration* Benefits: Team up with talented people to overcome individual weaknesses and generate richer ideas.* Chemistry: Crucial for successful collaboration; diverse strengths can complement each other.* Roles: Delineate duties (e.g., lyricist, composer) or allow for fluid contributions.* Band/Artist Collaboration: Adapt your style to theirs, understand group dynamics, and offer ideas that serve their vision.* Script Collaboration (Film/TV): Use storyline, characters, language, and style as inspiration.* Credit Division: Decide splits early (e.g., 50/50, 60/40), honor system, avoid "Spinal Tap" arguments.C. Song Demos* Purpose: To demonstrate a song's potential to interested parties (publishers, artists, producers).* Readiness: Ensure lyrics, melody, structure, hook, and emotion are well-crafted.* Production: Can be simple (piano/vocal) or complex; should effectively represent the song. Professional quality is advantageous.* Format: Primarily audio files (MP3s) or CDs.* Content: Must include lyrics, melody, chords, feel, genre, and heart/soul.* Musicians vs. Machines: Real musicians offer chemistry; programmed instruments (drum machines, synthesizers) offer flexibility and cost-effectiveness.* Arrangement: The musical shape of the song; sets the tone, determines market, and enhances presentation. Can be a "head arrangement" or fully notated.* Recording Location: Professional studios offer expertise and equipment; home studios are cost-effective but require technical aptitude.* Packaging: Simple and attractive, with all essential contact information clearly visible (on CD and jacket).D.

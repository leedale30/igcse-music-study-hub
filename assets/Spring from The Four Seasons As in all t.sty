Spring from The Four Seasons As in all the concertos forming The Four Seasons, this is in three movements fast-slow-fast.  
Instruments 
Each  concerto  is  scored  for  solo  violin  accompanied  by  string  orchestra.  In  a  concerto  the  orchestra  may  
sometimes be referred to as the tutti. In the score the solo line appears at the top, followed by the two orchestral 
violin parts, then the viola (in the alto clef) and finally the bass and continuo line. This would have been played 
by several instruments, including cellos, probably double basses (sounding an octave lower) and also an 
instrument capable of playing chords over the printed bass line. In performance this part can be realised by a 
harpsichord, organ or plucked string instrument such as a theorbo. Numbers under the bass stave (known as 
figured bass) indicate the chords to be played. Together these instruments are known as the basso continuo 
(often simply ‘continuo’) and are an absolutely crucial part of any Baroque piece of music, not just concertos.

Learners should be aware that a range of instruments can be the basso continuo. They can explore this by 
listening to recordings of different pieces and even to different recordings of the same piece. 
Baroque orchestral music sometimes included wind (flutes, oboes or bassoons), brass (trumpets or horns) or 
timpani, but in small numbers and always with the strings as the main part of the ensemble. 
The solo violinist and the orchestra make use of a range of techniques, including tremolo (bar 44). There is 
also significant use of ornamentation, as frequently found in Baroque music; here it is used to suggest birdsong. 
In the final movement of ‘Spring’ the orchestral violins are muted (con sordino). Throughout the concerto the 
solo part is much more virtuosic than that of the orchestra and is generally at a higher pitch. Movement 1 (Allegro) 
Structure / form 
As would be expected in a Baroque solo concerto first fast movement, the structure is ritornello form. This is 
when  varied  restatements of  a  ritornello  theme, in different  keys  and  scored  for  the full  orchestra,  alternate  
with episodes, in which the soloist often dominates playing new ideas. Vivaldi’s ritornello statements usually 
get shorter during a movement, as repetitions of bars or even whole groups of bars are omitted. In this concerto 
Vivaldi combines the poems with ritornello form, so the constant elements of the poem are usually incorporated 
into the returning ritornello theme, while the episodes depict the changing elements. Vivaldi sets the first five 
lines of the poem in this movement. Ritornello 1 bars 0 to 133 Episode 1 bars 133 to 273 Ritornello 2 bars 274 to 301  (a shortened statement of the ritornello theme, taken from bars 64 to 101. Episode 2 bars 31 to 403 Ritornello 3 bars 404 to 43 (a shortened statement, as in ritornello 2) Episode 3 bars 44 to 553 Ritornello 4 bars 554 to 58 Episode 4 bars 59 to 75 (this episode includes a tutti interruption, based on the first half of the ritornello 
theme. It also has many similarities to Episode 1, since both episodes refer to birdsong). Ritornello 5 bars 76 to 82 (this is longer than ritornellos 2, 3 and 4, but still not as long as ritornello 1. It 
is the second half of ritornello 1, which is then repeated). 
Tonality / keys 
As with most Baroque works, Vivaldi modulates to a variety of keys in the movement, but all closely related to 
the tonic. The first movement is in E major, a bright, joyful key, appropriate for the happy arrival of spring. 
The movement remains in E major for some time. Episode 2 ends on the dominant chord (B major), but the 
music  has  not  really  modulated  at  this  point.  However,  the  ritornello  which  immediately  follows  is  in  the  
dominant – the A sharps and perfect cadence in the dominant linking the ritornello and following episode show 
this. At the end of Episode 3 the music modulates from the dominant (B major) to the relative minor (C# minor). 
Ritornello 4 and Episode 4 are both in the relative minor, but at the end  of Episode 4 there is a modulation 
back to E major for the final ritornello. 
The second movement of the concert is in the relative minor (C# minor) and the final movement returns to E 
major.

Harmony 
Vivaldi’s harmony is diatonic (using notes from the key) and functional (with chords having a specific role in 
moving  the  music  forward).  There  is  much  use  of  tonic  and  dominant  chords,  with  perfect  and  imperfect  
cadences.  The opening ritornello is very firmly based on the tonic chord, with a rhythmicised tonic pedal in the continuo. 
Bars 3 and 6 contain an imperfect cadence, while bars 9–10 and 12–13 form a perfect cadence.  Interestingly, Episode 1 is based entirely on the tonic chord, with no change of harmony. 
When Episode 4 is accompanied by the continuo (unlike the corresponding section about birds in Episode 1), 
it is by a tonic pedal (C# as the music is in C# minor at this point) played by the cello (Tasto solo in the score 
means that the rest of the continuo do not play). 
Melody 
The ritornello sections have a memorable melody with a range of a 9th  and  making  use  of  mostly stepwise  
movement or leaps of a third. The episodes are less ‘melodic’ using repeated notes, scales and  arpeggios. 
The episodes also feature ornamentation, including inverted mordents and trills. Although most melodic material is diatonic, there is ascending chromatic movement in the bass in Episode 3, 
helping the music to modulate from B major to C# minor. 
Rhythm 
This movement uses a wide range of note values, from the crotchets, quavers and occasional semiquavers in 
the ritornello, to the demisemiquavers, triplet semiquavers and dotted notes in the episodes. This is another 
way in which Vivaldi creates contrast between the sections. 
Bar 73-4 features syncopation, used frequently in the following bars. 
Dynamics 
Baroque composers often did not write dynamic markings into their scores. This was because they were either 
leading  the  performances  and  could  tell  the  instrumentalists  how  to  play  or  because  musicians  at  the  time  
knew  the  expected  conventions.  Baroque  music  is  famous  for  using  terraced  dynamics,  where  there  are  
sudden changes from loud to quiet or vice versa. There is an example of this right at the start of the movement, 
where Vivaldi marks the repeat of the opening material to be played piano, followed by a return to forte at the 
end of bar 6, etc. Different performances will offer their own interpretation of the music, particularly with regard to dynamics and 
learners could compare the different versions. 
Texture 
Baroque  music  is  often  associated  with  polyphonic  or  contrapuntal  textures  and  there  are  examples  in  this  
movement such as Episode 1. This also makes use of imitation, with the solo 1st violin imitating the soloist two 
bars later. However, the opening of the movement is homophonic. There are also moments of monophony, 
such as bars 47 and 50. The episodes usually feature fewer instruments – just the three solo violins in Episode 1, three solo violins and 
cello in Episode 4. However, Episode 2 uses the whole orchestra (with the soloist doubling the 1st violin part) 
and e pisode alternates soloist and orchestra, before they come together.

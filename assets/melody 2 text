| **1. I.** Tick the two musical terms that best describe the shape of the melody in bar 1. | **Conjunct** (✓) and **Descending** (✓). | **Conjunct** movement means the melody moves mainly by step, using semitones or tones, so the notes are close together. **Descending** means the melody is moving lower in pitch. |
| **1. II.** Give the name of a melodic device used in bars 2 and 3. | **Imitation**. | **Imitation** is a compositional device where a short musical idea or motif is played by one part and is then immediately copied by another instrument or voice. |
| **1. III. i.** State the term that best describes the shape of the melody in bar 4. | **Disjunct**. | **Disjunct** movement involves the melody moving mainly by leaps, meaning the notes are further away and the melody has a more angular feel. |
| **1. III. ii.** Underline the name of the interval featured in bar 4. | **5th**. | An **interval** is the gap or distance in pitch between any two notes. |
| **1. III. iii.** Give the name of a melodic device used in bars 4² – 6² in the right-hand part. | **Sequence**. | A **sequence** is when a melodic idea (motif) is repeated but starting on a different pitch (either ascending or descending). This device is often used to expand thematic material. |

This detailed timeline is specifically designed for a student working on Composition 2 (Pop Song) using Apple Logic Pro and MuseScore, aiming for the highest possible marks (Level 5 in all criteria). The instructions are written to be clear and direct, focusing on required outputs and mandatory documentation.

I. Summary of Maximum Grade Requirements (Level 5)
To achieve the maximum marks (25/25), your song must be musically inventive and your documentation must be detailed, accurate, and professional. You must submit a high-quality audio recording along with both a Lead Sheet (notation) and a detailed Written Commentary, ensuring they work together to explain your music.
CriterionWhat the Examiner Looks For (Level 5)Focus Area in the PlanA: IdeasStrong and inventive melody/rhythm that clearly matches your stated brief. Ideas must be original (no pre-made loops/samples).Phase 1: Planning and SketchingB: StructureClear and appropriate structure (e.g., Verse-Chorus-Bridge) with inventive contrast and clear links between sections.Phase 1 & 2: ArrangementC: Use of MediumImaginative use of sounds (instruments/synths) appropriate to the Pop style (idiomatic writing). Demonstrate a broad range of varied textures.Phase 2: ProductionD: Compositional TechniqueConfident handling of materials (development). Use sophisticated techniques like modulation or sequential variation. Use convincing harmony (not just simple chords).Phase 2: DevelopmentE: DocumentationDetailed Commentary that is consistently analytical and accurate, using timings and musical vocabulary. Lead Sheet must be clear, well-presented and show performance details.Phase 3: Meticulous Proofing
II. Step-by-Step Composition Timeline (Sept 23 ? Oct 14)
This plan ensures time is dedicated to the core composition during the holiday period (Oct 1?8) and sufficient time is left for the essential task of documentation (Oct 9?14).
PHASE 1: Planning and Foundation (Sept 23 ? Sept 30)
(Focus on Criteria A: Ideas, B: Structure, and D: Harmony)
Date RangeCore TaskStep-by-Step Instructions for Max MarksMon 23 ? Tues 24 SeptDefine the Brief (A)1. Write the Brief: State clearly that the composition is under 'Music and words'. Define a specific Pop genre (e.g., Indie Pop) and the target audience/occasion. 2. Plan Structure (B): Choose a complex structure (e.g., Intro, V1, Pre-C, C, V2, B, C, Outro). Plan sectional contrasts (e.g., Verse sparse, Chorus full). 3. Lyrical Concept: Decide the story or emotional message. Write draft lyrics using the Logic Pro Notepad.Wed 25 ? Fri 27 SeptDevelop Core Music (A, D)1. Harmony (D): Find an interesting chord progression. Plan to use 7th chords or inverted chords to show sophistication. Plan a simple modulation (key change) for the final chorus (e.g., up a semitone). 2. Melody & Rhythm (A): Create a catchy lead vocal melody (A). Use sequence/repetition with slight changes. Ensure the rhythm of the melody matches the natural rhythm of the words (prosody).Sat 28 ? Mon 30 SeptSet Up Logic & Rhythm (B, C)1. Logic Setup: Start the Logic project. Use Arrangement Markers to define all sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, etc.) (Crit. B evidence). 2. Rhythm: Program a unique drum/rhythm track. Use syncopation to make the rhythm inventive (Crit. A).
PHASE 2: Production and Development (Oct 1 ? Oct 8: Holiday Break)
(Focus on Criteria C: Medium, D: Technique, and finalizing A/B)
Date RangeCore TaskStep-by-Step Instructions for Max MarksTues 1 ? Thurs 3 OctVocal Line & Texture (C, D)1. Vocal Synthesis: Input your finalized vocal melody into Synthesizer V or MuseScore. Ensure the lyrics are correctly aligned with the notes in the notation software. 2. Layering (C): Add harmonic backing parts (bass, pads, secondary melodies). Build distinct textural layers for each section (e.g., quiet texture in the Verse, full texture in the Chorus).Fri 4 ? Sat 5 OctDevelopment & Technique (D)1. Implement Development: Apply the planned key change (modulation) in the Bridge/Final Chorus. Use techniques like sequence or imitation in instrument parts to extend initial ideas. 2. Idiomatic Use (C): Use Logic Pro?s effects (Reverb, Delay, Chorus effect) creatively and ensure the chosen synth sounds match the Pop genre. CRUCIAL: Ensure instrument choices are different from Composition 1 (or score 0 for C).Sun 6 ? Tues 8 OctMixing & Export (C, E)1. Rough Mix (C): Adjust levels so the vocal melody is clearly heard above the accompaniment. Clean up the vocal track (e.g., simple use of Logic?s DeEsser/Compressor). 2. Final Export: Bounce the finished song as an MP3 file. Check: Turn the metronome/click track OFF.
PHASE 3: Documentation and Presentation (Oct 9 ? Oct 14)
(Focus on Criterion E: Documentation)
NOTE: Because you are submitting both a lead sheet and a detailed commentary, you can use the Lead Sheet to clearly show the melody and rhythm (Option i) and the Commentary to explain the complex production and development (Option ii). This combination strongly supports all grading criteria.
Date RangeCore TaskStep-by-Step Instructions for Max MarksWed 9 ? Thurs 10 OctCreate Lead Sheet (E)1. MuseScore Import: Export the vocal melody (MIDI) from Logic into MuseScore (or input directly). 2. Notation Detail: Create a Lead Sheet. This must include: the vocal melody line (staff notation), the lyrics, the chord symbols, tempo markings, and dynamics. 3. Format: Ensure the layout is clean, clear, and easy to read. Use rehearsal marks (like 'V1', 'C1', 'B') to mark structure.Fri 11 ? Sat 12 OctAnnotate Documentation (A, B, C, D)1. Logic Screenshots (E): Take multiple screenshots of your Logic Pro session. Include: The Arrangement page (showing all tracks and arrangement markers). The mixer/FX window (showing effects used on the vocal or key instruments). 2. Musical Bars: Take screenshots of specific musical bars (from MuseScore or Logic's score view) to show complex sections. For example: show the melody phrasing, the syncopated rhythm, or the modulation bars. 3. Annotate: Clearly label all screenshots/lead sheet using arrows and text boxes (e.g., "Criterion D: This is the sequence used in the bass line"). Annotation is highly effective for proving your compositional intent.Sun 13 ? Mon 14 Oct (Deadline)Write Commentary & Final Review (E)1. Write Commentary: Use the required template. The commentary must state how the composition fulfills the brief. 2. Analysis: Write a detailed section addressing Criteria A, B, C, and D, using musical vocabulary. Include timings (e.g., "The texture thickens at 1:15 in the pre-chorus"). 3. Technology Declaration: Explicitly list Logic Pro, MuseScore, and any vocal synth (e.g., Synthesizer V) used. Declare any use of samples, loops, or auto-accompaniment features. 4. Final Check: Ensure the composition differs from Composition 1. Check all submitted files are correctly labeled and included (Audio MP3, Lead Sheet PDF, Commentary/Annotated Document).

        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: `<h2>Aos02 04 Language Literacy And Theory</h2><p> 1750–1810). This comprehensive framework, structured according to Section 4 (Language, Literacy, and Theory) of the analysis lexicon, ensures candidates are fully prepared to demonstrate sophisticated analytical and descriptive skills (AO1).</p>
<hr/>
<h2>4. Language, Literacy, and Theory: Area of Study 2 (Classical Music)</h2>
<h3>4.1. Specific Terminology: Genre-specific vocabulary</h3>
<p>For Classical music, your analytical vocabulary must be precise, focusing on clear structures, balanced phrasing, and homophonic clarity.</p>
<div className="table-responsive"><table className="table table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Terminology Focus</th><th>Definition and Application for Classical Music</th><th>Source Citations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Form/Structure</strong></td><td>You must master <strong>sonata form</strong> terminology, including the <strong>Exposition</strong>, <strong>Development</strong>, and <strong>Recapitulation</strong>. Specific internal terms are required: <strong>First Subject</strong> (Tonic key), <strong>Second Subject</strong> (Dominant or Relative Major key), <strong>Transition</strong> (modulating passage), <strong>Codetta</strong>, <strong>Coda</strong>, and <strong>Introduction</strong>. Other essential structures include <strong>Rondo</strong> (ABACA, etc.), <strong>Minuet and Trio</strong>, and <strong>Theme and Variations</strong>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accompaniment Devices</strong></td><td>The <strong>Alberti bass</strong> is a mandatory term, referring to the broken triad accompaniment pattern (lowest, highest, middle, highest note) characteristic of this era. You must also recognize <strong>pedal notes</strong> (tonic or dominant pedal).</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Melody and Devices</strong></td><td>Melodies are defined by <strong>balanced phrases</strong> (often in antecedent/consequent, or question-and-answer patterns). Mandatory devices include <strong>repetition</strong>, <strong>ascending sequence</strong>, <strong>descending sequence</strong>, and <strong>imitation</strong>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ensemble</strong></td><td>The term <strong>Chamber music</strong> defines the primary focus of this unit: instrumental music played by a small group with <strong>one player per part</strong>. You must be familiar with common ensembles like the <strong>string quartet</strong> and <strong>piano trio</strong>.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h3>4.2. Lyrics &amp; Text Analysis: The study of the words, including their poetic structure, narrative, imagery, and symbolism.</h3>
<p>The core of Area of Study 2 focuses on <strong>instrumental chamber music</strong>, which does not involve lyrics or text (Focus Work: Mozart’s <em>Quintet for piano and winds</em>).</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Conclusion:</strong> NOT APPLICABLE. (Note: While vocal genres like Opera and Oratorio were composed in the Classical period, they are not the focus of AOS 2.)</li></ul>
<h3>4.3. Notation System: How music is recorded—staff notation, cipher, neumes, graphic scores, etc.</h3>
<p>Classical music relies exclusively on Western staff notation, demanding precision in reading and interpretation. Your study of Focus Works is explicitly designed to develop these score-reading and analytical skills.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Staff Notation Mastery:</strong> You must be proficient in reading and interpreting standard <strong>staff notation</strong>, including <strong>treble, bass, and alto clefs</strong>. This includes recognizing <strong>key signatures of up to four sharps or flats</strong> and identifying <strong>major, minor, and perfect intervals</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Rhythmic Literacy:</strong> You must recognize all rhythmic note values, including <strong>triplets</strong> and <strong>dotted rhythms</strong>. You should be able to identify <strong>simple and compound time signatures</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Transposing Instruments:</strong> You must investigate and apply knowledge of <strong>transposing instruments</strong> found in Classical scores, specifically: <strong>trumpets in B flat, clarinets in B flat and A, and horns in F and E flat</strong>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [MUSIC SCORE: Excerpt from Mozart’s <em>Quintet K. 452</em> score, illustrating the Horn in E flat part and the Clarinet in B flat part at written pitch, followed by the score at concert pitch, demonstrating the concept of transposition.]</li><li>  [YOUTUBE LINK: Tutorial video explaining the transposition required for a Classical French Horn in F.]</li></ul>
<h3>4.4. Oral/Aural Tradition: Transmission of music through listening and imitation rather than written form.</h3>
<p>Although a fully notated tradition, performance relies on highly skilled aural interpretation.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Aural Analysis:</strong> The main component of your assessment (Paper 1) relies entirely on your ability to accurately <strong>recognize and describe</strong> musical elements. This is an aural skill, requiring you to identify elements like <strong>sonata form sections, cadences (perfect, imperfect, interrupted)</strong>, and texture (homophonic, polyphonic) purely by listening.</li><li> <strong>Interpretive Skill:</strong> The expressive nature of Classical music demands careful attention to performance conventions that go beyond the written score, such as precise <strong>dynamics, phrasing, and articulation</strong>. These are often matters of convention, which is a form of aural tradition. You must recognize and correctly use Italian terms like <em>crescendo</em>, <em>diminuendo</em>, <em>legato</em>, and <em>staccato</em>.</li></ul>
<h3>4.5. Music Theory Framework: The theoretical system underpinning the music (e.g., Western harmony, Javanese <em>slendro/pelog</em>).</h3>
<p>The Classical period consolidated the rules of Western Tonality that you must understand.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Tonality and Scales:</strong> The framework is built upon the <strong>major and minor key system</strong>. You must recognize when a melody is <strong>diatonic</strong> (using notes from the key).</li><li> <strong>Harmony:</strong> Harmony is highly <strong>functional</strong> and reliant on <strong>primary and secondary chords</strong>. You must distinguish between <strong>consonant</strong> (stable) and <strong>dissonant</strong> (unstable) harmony.</li><li> <strong>Chord Types:</strong> You must identify <strong>dominant seventh</strong> and <strong>diminished seventh</strong> chords.</li><li> <strong>Cadences:</strong> Essential knowledge includes recognizing and naming the function of <strong>perfect, imperfect, and interrupted</strong> cadences by ear.</li><li> <strong>Modulation:</strong> You must recognize <strong>modulation to related keys</strong> (dominant, subdominant, relative major, and relative minor).</li><li> <strong>Ornamentation:</strong> You must be able to aurally identify and name ornaments, including the <strong>trill, mordent, turn, appoggiatura, and acciaccatura</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Suspensions:</strong> Understanding and recognition of <strong>suspensions</strong> is required.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [DIAGRAM: Notation illustrating the V-I Perfect Cadence versus the II/IV-V Imperfect Cadence, used to mark phrases in Classical music.]</li><li>  [YOUTUBE LINK: Example of a movement in sonata form (e.g., Mozart Symphony No. 40, Mvt. 1) highlighting the moment of modulation to the dominant key in the exposition.]</li></ul>` }} />

<p>This study is mandatory, equipping you with the critical vocabulary and analytical depth to discuss the stylistic features of the 19th century.</p>

<h2>3. Cultural and Historical Context: Area of Study 3 (Romantic Music)</h2>
<p>The Romantic period marks a profound shift in music, moving from the structured elegance of the Classical era toward intense individual emotion, dramatic contrasts, and large-scale storytelling.</p>
<h3>3.1. Cultural Function: The role music plays in society.</h3>
<p>Music during this era fulfilled increasingly public and emotional roles, reflecting the rise of the middle class and a fascination with imagination and feeling.</p>
<h4>3.1.1.1. Ritual</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE. (The focus in this AOS is on secular orchestral works, not sacred ritual music like Masses or Oratorios, although those genres still existed.)</p>
<h4>3.1.1.2. Celebration</h4>
<p>Music was increasingly created for <strong>public concerts</strong> and secular celebration, marking the establishment of the modern concert repertoire. Genres like the <strong>Symphony</strong>, <strong>Concerto</strong>, and <strong>Overture</strong> (including the freestanding Concert Overture) were central to public life and entertainment.</p>
<h4>3.1.1.3. Work, protest</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE.</p>
<h4>3.1.1.4. Healing</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE.</p>
<h4>3.1.1.5. Social Identity</h4>
This is a core concept for Romantic music. A powerful spirit of <strong>Nationalism</strong> emerged, particularly in Eastern Europe. Composers sought to express a distinctive national identity by incorporating:<br/><ul><li>  Folk melodies and traditional songs.</li><li>  Elements from their country’s life, history, or legends.</li><li>  Traditional <strong>dance forms</strong>, such as the <em>Polka</em>.</li></ul>
<p>The Focus Work, Smetana’s <em>Vltava</em>, is a direct example of this, describing a river in Smetana’s native Bohemia (now Czech Republic).</p>
<h3>3.2. Historical Background: The evolution of the style or tradition and its socio-political influences.</h3>
<p>The Romantic period (roughly 1810 to 1900) was defined by two major shifts: the decline of court patronage and the <strong>expansion of the orchestra</strong>.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Patronage Shift:</strong> The social changes following the French Revolution led to a gradual reduction in the aristocratic patronage that supported composers like Haydn and Mozart. Composers increasingly worked independently, relying on income from the <strong>performance and publication</strong> of their music. This freedom fostered greater <strong>individuality of style</strong> and intense, personal expression of emotion.</li><li> <strong>Orchestra Expansion:</strong> The orchestra underwent a massive increase in both size and range.</li><li> <strong>Woodwind:</strong> New instruments like the <strong>piccolo, cor anglais, bass clarinet, and contrabassoon</strong> provided a broader range of tone colour and pitch.</li><li> <strong>Brass:</strong> The invention of the <strong>valve</strong> allowed brass instruments to play a full <strong>chromatic scale</strong>, increasing their range and flexibility. The brass section grew substantially, including three trombones and a <strong>tuba</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Strings:</strong> The string section increased in number to balance the greater sound weight of the brass and woodwind sections, and instruments like the <strong>harp</strong> were commonly added.</li><li> <strong>Percussion:</strong> A wider variety of <strong>tuned and untuned percussion</strong> was incorporated for dramatic effects.</li><li> <strong>Programme Music:</strong> Instrumental music became increasingly programmatic, aiming to describe a specific story, poem, or scene (Programmatic music tells a story without using words). The Focus Work, <em>Vltava</em>, is a <strong>symphonic poem</strong> (or tone poem), a single-movement orchestral work that directly follows a narrative—the journey of a river.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [DIAGRAM: Comparison of the size and instrumentation (brass, woodwind, percussion) of a Classical orchestra vs. a Romantic symphony orchestra.]</li></ul>
<h3>3.3. Movement &amp; Dance: The physical embodiment of the music and its relationship with specific dance forms.</h3>
<p>While the focus works are orchestral tone poems, traditional dance rhythms were essential to the era, often incorporated into larger works as part of the Nationalist movement.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Specific Dances:</strong> The <em>Polka</em> was a lively Central European dance in duple metre. The country wedding section of <em>Vltava</em>, for instance, represents a wedding and is written in the style of a <strong>polka</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Piano Miniatures:</strong> Short, character pieces for solo piano often included dances like the <strong>Waltz</strong> and <strong>Mazurka</strong>.</li></ul>
<h3>3.4. Economics &amp; Patronage: The financial systems supporting the music's creation.</h3>
<p>The economic support system underwent fundamental change.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Decline of Aristocracy:</strong> The traditional model where composers like Haydn were staff members of wealthy households largely disappeared.</li><li> <strong>Rise of the Public/Commercial Market:</strong> Composers increasingly depended on income generated from the <strong>performance and publication</strong> of their compositions.</li><li> <strong>Virtuoso Culture:</strong> The period fostered the rise of the <strong>Virtuoso</strong> performer (like pianist Franz Liszt), whose immense technical skill drew large paying audiences to public concert halls, generating significant commercial income.</li></ul>
<h3>3.5. Key Works/Pieces: Canonical or representative compositions that define the genre or tradition.</h3>
<p>You are required to study the Focus Work to understand the Romantic style, particularly its programmatic elements and orchestral treatment.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Focus Work:</strong> <strong>Smetana: <em>Vltava</em> from <em>Ma Vlast</em></strong>. This programmatic work should be used to exemplify:</li><li>  The expansion of the orchestra.</li><li>  The importance of programme music.</li><li>  The expression of national identity (Nationalism).</li><li> <strong>Wider Listening Examples (for reference, not examined):</strong></li><li> <strong>Mendelssohn: <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream overture</em></strong>: An example of a concert overture and programme music.</li><li> <strong>Chopin: <em>Étude in E, Op 10. No 3</em></strong>: Demonstrates Romantic piano music, focusing on <strong>ternary structure</strong> (ABA) and rich <strong>chromatic harmony</strong>.</li></ul>
<h3>3.6. Key Composers/Artists: Influential figures who shaped or revolutionized the music.</h3>
<p>Key composers associated with the Romantic period include:</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Bedřich Smetana:</strong> Focus composer, known for his Nationalist works like <em>Vltava</em>.</li><li> <strong>Felix Mendelssohn:</strong> Known for works like the <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream overture</em>.</li><li> <strong>Frédéric Chopin:</strong> Central figure in Romantic piano music.</li><li> <strong>Clara Schumann, Emilie Mayer, Alexander Borodin, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Franz Liszt, and Niccolò Paganini</strong>.</li></ul>
<h3>3.7. Performance Practice: Traditional ways of interpreting and presenting music.</h3>
<h4>3.7.1.1. Staging</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE (The focus works are orchestral pieces intended for the concert hall, not staged theatre).</p>
<h4>3.7.1.2. Performer/audience relationship</h4>
<p>The relationship became less intimate and more hierarchical than in the Baroque and Classical chamber settings.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Public Concerts:</strong> Music shifted from private salons to large public concert halls.</li><li> <strong>The Virtuoso:</strong> Audiences developed a love for brilliant soloists, who commanded the stage and demonstrated extraordinary technical skill (<strong>virtuosity</strong>).</li><li> <strong>Conductors:</strong> The larger orchestra and complex scores required a formal <strong>conductor</strong> to lead and interpret the work, a role that became increasingly important in this era.</li><li> <strong>Expressive Interpretation:</strong> Performers were expected to convey intense emotion, often using <strong>rubato</strong> (flexible tempo) to vary the speed expressively.</li></ul>
<h4>3.7.1.3. Attire</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE.</p>
<h4>3.7.1.4. Ritualistic elements</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE (Focus is on secular orchestral music.)</p>` }} />

<h2>4. Language, Literacy, and Theory: Area of Study 3 (Romantic Music)</h2>
<h3>4.1. Specific Terminology: Genre-specific vocabulary</h3>
<p>You must acquire and use advanced musical vocabulary to accurately describe the expressive, large-scale, and programmatic nature of Romantic music.</p>
<div className="table-responsive"><table className="table table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Terminology Focus</th><th>Definition and Application</th><th>Source Citations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Genre</strong></td><td><strong>Programme Music:</strong> Instrumental music that tells a story or sets a scene without using words. The Focus Work, Smetana's <em>Vltava</em>, is an example of a <strong>Symphonic Poem</strong> (or tone poem), a single-movement orchestral work, typically programmatic.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Orchestration &amp; Timbre</strong></td><td>Terminology related to the <strong>expansion of the orchestra</strong>. This includes instruments like the <strong>Tuba</strong> (lowest brass instrument), <strong>Piccolo</strong> (highest woodwind), <strong>Cor Anglais</strong> (alto oboe), <strong>Contrabassoon</strong> (lowest woodwind), and <strong>Harp</strong>. You must be able to describe orchestration and arrangement using terms like <strong>Scored</strong>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Melody &amp; Device</strong></td><td><strong>Leitmotif:</strong> A recurring musical theme associated with a particular person, idea, object, or emotion, highly prominent in Romantic music. Melodies are often <strong>Lyrical</strong> (rich and song-like).</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rhythm</strong></td><td><strong>Rubato:</strong> A flexible approach to tempo where the speed is slightly varied for intense expressive purposes. You must also recognize traditional dance forms integrated for national identity, such as the <strong>Polka</strong>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structure</strong></td><td>When dealing with overtures (like Mendelssohn’s <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream overture</em>), you must apply the full vocabulary of <strong>Sonata Form</strong> (Exposition, Development, Recapitulation, Transition, Coda). You must also recognize <strong>Concert Overture</strong>.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h3>4.2. Lyrics &amp; Text Analysis</h3>
<p>Since the focus is on <strong>instrumental music</strong> (orchestral works), candidates deal primarily with <strong>extra-musical ideas</strong> rather than lyrics.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Programme Analysis:</strong> You must analyze how the musical features are employed to reflect the <strong>narrative or visual scene</strong> intended by the composer (i.e., Programme Music).</li><li> <strong>Symbolism through Music:</strong> You are expected to describe how specific musical characteristics <strong>suggest</strong> elements of the extra-musical text. For example, in Smetana's <em>Vltava</em>, you must identify musical suggestions for the two springs, the river's main theme, the country wedding (<strong>Polka</strong>), and the rapid water (rapids).</li><li> <strong>Melodic &amp; Harmonic Imagery:</strong> Analyze how devices like <strong>chromaticism</strong> (for emotional turmoil), <strong>rising scales</strong> (for tension or climax), or specific instrumental colours (e.g., brass <strong>fanfare</strong> for heroic elements) are used to convey the intended imagery of the story.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [PLACEHOLDER: AUDIO: Extract from Smetana's <em>Vltava</em> representing the 'country wedding' section, demonstrating the rhythm of the Polka dance in duple metre.]</li><li>  [YOUTUBE LINK: BBC Guide to Smetana's Vltava highlighting the different programmatic sections (Suggested contextual resource)]</li></ul>
<h3>4.3. Notation System</h3>
<p>Romantic music uses standard Western staff notation. Due to the complex nature of the orchestration, deep literacy in staff notation is required for score reading (which supports the listening exam).</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Staff Notation:</strong> Mastery of <strong>staff notation</strong> is assumed, including <strong>treble, bass, and alto clefs</strong>. You must read the wide range of rhythmic values, including <strong>triplets</strong> and <strong>dotted rhythms</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Transposing Instruments:</strong> A critical skill in this era is understanding the notation of transposing instruments, which became numerous due to the expanded brass and woodwind sections. You must know how to transpose for: <strong>Trumpets in B flat, Clarinets in B flat and A, and Horns in F and E flat</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Expression Markings:</strong> Notation is detailed, with precise dynamic markings across the entire range from <em>pp</em> to <em>ff</em> (and sometimes even <em>fff</em>), as well as articulation marks like <strong>sforzando</strong> (sudden accent).</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [MUSIC SCORE: Excerpt from a Romantic orchestral score (e.g., Mendelssohn Overture) showing a Horn in F part written at pitch, and the corresponding sounding pitch, demonstrating transposition]</li><li>  [PLACEHOLDER: DIAGRAM showing the written and sounding notes for a Clarinet in A.]</li></ul>
<h3>4.4. Oral/Aural Tradition</h3>
<p>While Romantic music is fully written down, the expressive intent and the technical requirements of the listening paper rely heavily on aural perception (AO1).</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Aural Recognition of Style:</strong> You must be able to aurally identify stylistic features typical of the Romantic era, such as <strong>large orchestra</strong> and <strong>prominent use of brass instruments</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Interpretive Practice:</strong> The expressive use of tempo, marked by <strong>Rubato</strong>, relies entirely on the performer's interpretation, a practice that transcends mere written notation.</li><li> <strong>Aural Analysis:</strong> The exam requires identifying musical devices and structural sections by listening alone, necessitating acute aural familiarity with complex elements like <strong>chromatic harmony</strong>, <strong>unexpected modulations</strong>, and the difference between sections of <strong>sonata form</strong> (Exposition, Development, Recapitulation).</li></ul>
<h3>4.5. Music Theory Framework</h3>
<p>Romantic music operates within an expanded and harmonically enriched Western theoretical framework.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Tonality and Modulation:</strong> Music is based on the <strong>major and minor key system</strong>, but modulation is frequent and complex. You must be able to recognize modulation to <strong>related keys</strong> (dominant, subdominant, relative major/minor). Harmony often employs <strong>Chromaticism</strong> and <strong>Dissonance</strong> to increase emotional impact and tension.</li><li> <strong>Harmony:</strong> You must identify <strong>Dominant Seventh</strong> and <strong>Diminished Seventh</strong> chords, which are used to create suspense and facilitate modulation. The use of <strong>pedal notes</strong> (tonic pedal, dominant pedal) is also required knowledge. You must be able to identify all three major cadences: <strong>perfect, imperfect, and interrupted</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Structure:</strong> Single-movement orchestral works frequently follow classical forms like <strong>Sonata Form</strong>, or are <strong>Through-composed</strong> if they strictly follow a narrative.</li><li> <strong>Devices and Texture:</strong> You must recognize <strong>Homophonic</strong> texture (melody and accompaniment) and technical devices such as <strong>repetition</strong>, <strong>ascending/descending sequence</strong>, <strong>imitation</strong>, and <strong>ostinato</strong>.</li></ul>` }} />

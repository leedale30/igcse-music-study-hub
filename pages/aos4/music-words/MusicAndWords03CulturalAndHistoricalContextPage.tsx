<hr/>
<h2>3. Cultural and Historical Context: Area of Study 4 (Music and Words)</h2>
<p>This area explores three distinct genres—Art Song, Choral Music, and Popular/Musical Song—all united by the crucial element of <strong>word-setting</strong>. The repertoire for this topic extends from the early twentieth century to the present day.</p>
<h3>3.1. Cultural Function: The role music plays in society.</h3>
<h4>3.1.1.1. Ritual</h4>
<p>Sacred choral music continues to be written, meaning music still serves a ritualistic function in religious services (e.g., Masses or Anthems). However, an increasing amount of secular music is composed specifically to be performed in concerts, even if some pieces use religious texts (such as Stravinsky’s <em>Symphony of Psalms</em>).</p>
<h4>3.1.1.2. Celebration</h4>
Music in this area is fundamentally designed for entertainment and emotional connection.<br/><ul><li> <strong>Musicals:</strong> Songs from musicals are vocal works from the Western tradition of musical theatre, intended for public performance and enjoyment in theatres.</li><li> <strong>Popular Song:</strong> This genre, primarily defined from the 1990s onwards, is composed for entertainment and widespread appeal. Live performances occur in venues ranging from intimate settings to large stadiums.</li></ul>
<h4>3.1.1.3. Work, protest</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE. (The syllabus focuses on emotional connection and entertainment within this area.)</p>
<h4>3.1.1.4. Healing</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE.</p>
<h4>3.1.1.5. Social Identity</h4>
<p>Popular songs reflect <strong>contemporary social trends and cultural shifts</strong>. They help audiences connect emotionally and stylistically. The tradition of Art Song allows for highly <strong>intense and personal expression of emotion</strong>.</p>
<h3>3.2. Historical Background: The evolution of the style or tradition and its socio-political influences.</h3>
<p>The content covers a wide range, extending from the early twentieth century to the present day.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Art Song:</strong> The tradition of writing solo songs, so important in the Romantic era (with composers like Schubert writing over 500 songs), continued into the twentieth century with great creativity. Composers often grouped songs into <strong>song cycles</strong> (collections with a related theme or poet) intended to be sung consecutively.</li><li> <strong>Choral Music:</strong> Since the beginning of the twentieth century, composers have contributed a vast amount of music for choirs, ranging from simple unaccompanied works to huge compositions for large choral forces and orchestras.</li><li> <strong>Popular Song:</strong> This style, gaining widespread appeal <strong>primarily from the 1990s onwards</strong>, relies heavily on modern <strong>music production technology</strong> to achieve its defining sound. The rise of broadcast media and digital streaming platforms (like YouTube and Spotify) has fundamentally changed how this music is distributed and consumed globally.</li></ul>
<h3>3.3. Movement &amp; Dance: The physical embodiment of the music and its relationship with specific dance forms.</h3>
<p>While general dance is covered in AOS 5, the performance of songs from musicals is often tightly choreographed and integrated with physical movement.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Musicals:</strong> These songs are vocal works from the Western tradition of <strong>musical theatre</strong>. Live performances are primarily staged in theatres (like the West End and Broadway), where the music supports the dramatic action and choreography, often featuring <strong>elaborate visual effects, puppetry, and automated sets</strong>.</li><li>  [PLACEHOLDER: IMAGE or DIAGRAM of a stage setting, showing an orchestra pit, scenery, and performers in a musical theatre production.]</li></ul>
<h3>3.4. Economics &amp; Patronage: The financial systems supporting the music's creation.</h3>
<p>The economy of music creation varies greatly between the traditional Art Song model and the modern Pop model.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Traditional/Art Music:</strong> Composers of choral works and art songs rely on <strong>commissioning</strong> (patronage) for large works or income from the <strong>performance and publication</strong> of their music. Art songs are often written with <strong>piano accompaniment</strong>, though large orchestral commissions for solo voice also exist.</li><li> <strong>Commercial/Pop Music:</strong> Popular song production relies heavily on <strong>music technology</strong> (overdubbing, multi-tracking, double-tracking, effects like chorus and delay). Income is generated through <strong>live concerts and shows</strong> (often large, elaborate productions) and through the dissemination of music via <strong>radio, television, and digital streaming platforms</strong>.</li></ul>
<h3>3.5. Key Works/Pieces: Canonical or representative compositions that define the genre or tradition.</h3>
<p>The syllabus provides <em>Starting Points</em> that are intended to exemplify the main features of each style; they are <strong>not prescribed set works</strong> and will <strong>not</strong> be used in the examination.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Art Song Focus:</strong> The starting point is <strong>Libby Larsen: <em>Chanting to Paradise</em></strong>. Candidates are also encouraged to study works from the tradition, such as Ralph Vaughan Williams’s <strong><em>Songs of Travel</em></strong>, where the piano is used as an equal partner to portray meaning (e.g., a "striding bass" for the traveller’s determination or chromaticism for melancholy).</li><li> <strong>Music for Choirs Focus:</strong> The starting point is <strong>Jonathan Dove: <em>The Passing of the Year</em></strong>. This piece is exemplary in its use of complex textures, including antiphony and polyrhythms.</li><li> <strong>Popular Song/Musicals Focus:</strong> The starting point is <strong>Benj Pasek and Justin Paul: <em>A Million Dreams</em> from <em>The Greatest Showman</em></strong>. This is used to demonstrate common structures (verse/chorus) and the use of the orchestra to build drama.</li><li>  [YOUTUBE LINK: Libby Larsen: Out of Sight from Chanting to Paradise (Suggested listening example)]</li><li>  [YOUTUBE LINK: Jonathan Dove: III. Answer July from The Passing of the Year (Suggested listening example)]</li></ul>
<h3>3.6. Key Composers/Artists: Influential figures who shaped or revolutionized the music.</h3>
<p>You are explicitly <strong>not expected to identify or name any specific composers or performers</strong> for any extract in the examination from Area of Study 4.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>EXCLUSION:</strong> Candidates should focus only on identifying the musical features (e.g., word-painting, antiphonal texture, BPM) that define the style, rather than associating the music with a specific artist or time period.</li></ul>
<h3>3.7. Performance Practice: Traditional ways of interpreting and presenting music.</h3>
<p>Performance practices vary significantly depending on whether the music is written for a concert hall, church, or stage.</p>
<h4>3.7.1.1. Staging</h4>
<p><strong>Musicals</strong> are primarily performed in theatres, involving elaborate <strong>staging</strong> that may include <strong>special effects, projected visuals, puppetry, and automated sets</strong> to enhance the narrative. These pieces are written with live performance in mind, where <strong>vocal clarity and instrumental balance</strong> are paramount.</p>
<h4>3.7.1.2. Performer/audience relationship</h4>
The performance context determines the relationship:<br/><ul><li> <strong>Art Song/Choirs:</strong> Often performed in concert halls or churches, involving a defined performer-audience dynamic.</li><li> <strong>Popular Music:</strong> Performances often occur in large <strong>live concerts and shows</strong> (stadiums), featuring <strong>complex lighting, massive sound systems, and intricate visual effects</strong> designed to engage a large audience. The widespread distribution via <strong>digital streaming</strong> also defines a passive, broadcast audience relationship.</li></ul>
<h4>3.7.1.3. attire</h4>
<p>NOT APPLICABLE.</p>
<h4>3.7.1.4. ritualistic elements</h4>
<p>Sacred choral works (Masses) continue to serve a ritualistic function in church settings.</p>` }} />

<p>This area mandates the study of <strong>Art song for solo voice, music for choirs, popular song, and songs from musicals</strong>.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>4. Language, Literacy, and Theory: Area of Study 4 (Music and Words)</h2>
<h3>4.1. Specific Terminology: Genre-specific vocabulary</h3>
<p>You must acquire and consistently use terminology specific to modern song structure, vocal setting, and music production technology.</p>
<div className="table-responsive"><table className="table table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Terminology Focus</th><th>Definition and Application</th><th>Source Citations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Word-Setting Techniques</strong></td><td><strong>Melisma</strong> (setting one syllable of text to many notes in the melody line) and <strong>Syllabic</strong> (setting one note per syllable). Also includes <strong>Rap</strong> (rhythmic, spoken delivery of lyrics).</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Popular Song Structure</strong></td><td>Specific section names are mandatory: <strong>Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge / middle eight, and Outro</strong>. Structures include <strong>Strophic</strong> (same music repeats for each verse) and <strong>Through-composed</strong> (music continuously changes, following the narrative).</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Melodic Devices</strong></td><td><strong>Hook</strong> (a catchy, memorable sequence of notes) and <strong>Riff</strong> (a short, repeated pattern, often instrumental) are crucial elements of popular song. You must also recognize <strong>Call and response</strong> (a musical dialogue where one part answers another).</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Choral Textures</strong></td><td><strong>Antiphonal</strong> texture (where one group responds to another) and the division of voices into a <strong>Double choir</strong> are common in choral music.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Music Technology</strong></td><td><strong>Sample, loop, chorus, reverb, and delay</strong> are electronic effects and devices used to enhance and produce sound. Production techniques include <strong>overdubbing, double-tracking, and multi-tracking</strong>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tempo</strong></td><td>Tempo can be measured using <strong>BPM (beats per minute)</strong>, particularly in popular and electronic genres. You must also recognize tempo changes like <em>accelerando</em> and <em>rallentando</em>.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h3>4.2. Lyrics &amp; Text Analysis: The study of the words, including their poetic structure, narrative, imagery, and symbolism.</h3>
<p>This is the central analytical pillar of AOS 4. Candidates must explore the ways composers set words to music, focusing on musical features that <strong>enhance the meaning of the text</strong>.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Word-Painting:</strong> This is a crucial technique where specific musical features (like pitch, dynamics, or melody contour) directly illustrate the literal meaning of individual words or phrases. For example, using ascending scales in the piano to suggest the word 'reach'.</li><li> <strong>Melisma and Syllabic Setting:</strong> The choice between <strong>melisma</strong> (many notes per syllable, often for expressive elongation) and <strong>syllabic</strong> setting (one note per syllable, often for clarity or speed) is a conscious decision by the composer to affect the text's delivery.</li><li> <strong>Emotional Conveyance:</strong> Composers use harmony (e.g., <strong>chromaticism</strong> or <strong>dissonance</strong>) and tonality (<strong>minor key</strong> for melancholic feelings) to convey the emotional content or mood of the lyrics.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [PLACEHOLDER: MUSIC SCORE: An excerpt of a vocal melody illustrating an example of <strong>word-painting</strong> on the word 'falling' (e.g., using a descending, scalic line).]</li><li>  [YOUTUBE LINK: Libby Larsen: Out of Sight from <em>Chanting to Paradise</em> (Suggested listening example demonstrating word-painting and through-composed structure)]</li></ul>
<h3>4.3. Notation System: How music is recorded—staff notation, cipher, neumes, graphic scores, etc.</h3>
<p>While Western music is traditionally documented using staff notation, modern genres rely heavily on recording techniques and non-traditional methods.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Staff Notation:</strong> Standard Western notation is used for Art Song, Choral music, and scores from Musicals. Candidates must be able to read notation that includes all rhythmic note values (including <strong>triplets</strong> and <strong>dotted rhythms</strong>), common time signatures (duple, triple, quadruple, simple, and compound).</li><li> <strong>Commentary Alternative:</strong> For composition (Component 3), a detailed <strong>written commentary</strong> describing the composition's structure and content can be submitted as an alternative to a written score, which is particularly relevant when composing in genres like popular song or EDM where traditional notation may be less appropriate.</li></ul>
<h3>4.4. Oral/Aural Tradition: Transmission of music through listening and imitation rather than written form.</h3>
<p>Aural skills are paramount in this area, both for analysis and transmission in contemporary and popular contexts.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Aural Analysis (AO1):</strong> The examination requires accurate <strong>aural recognition</strong> of key elements, such as <strong>structure</strong> (identifying where the chorus returns or a bridge occurs) and <strong>texture</strong> (recognizing homophonic texture or antiphonal choral singing).</li><li> <strong>Pop/Digital Transmission:</strong> Popular songs and often pieces from Musicals are widely distributed via <strong>broadcast media</strong> and <strong>digital streaming platforms</strong>, where the primary mode of transmission and consumption is aural, not written.</li><li> <strong>Improvisation:</strong> Solo vocal parts, particularly in popular song and some Art Song traditions, may incorporate <strong>improvisation</strong>.</li></ul>
<h3>4.5. Music Theory Framework: The theoretical system underpinning the music (e.g., Western harmony, Javanese <em>slendro/pelog</em>).</h3>
<p>Music in this area relies on the Western tonal system but expands it with modal and chromatic elements.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Tonality and Harmony:</strong> You must recognize <strong>major and minor</strong> keys. While harmony is often <strong>diatonic</strong>, the use of <strong>chromatic harmony</strong> and <strong>dissonance</strong> is common, particularly in contemporary choral music and Art Song, to heighten expression.</li><li> <strong>Chord Vocabulary:</strong> Required knowledge includes <strong>primary and secondary chords</strong>, along with <strong>dominant seventh</strong> and <strong>diminished seventh</strong> chords.</li><li> <strong>Cadences:</strong> You must aurally identify the common harmonic progressions: <strong>perfect, imperfect, and interrupted cadences</strong>.</li><li> <strong>Scales:</strong> Recognition of <strong>modal scales</strong> is often necessary in Art Song and contemporary choral music, alongside <strong>major, minor, and chromatic</strong> scales.</li><li> <strong>Texture:</strong> You must distinguish between <strong>monophonic, homophonic / melody and accompaniment, polyphonic, and antiphonal</strong> textures in vocal ensembles.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [DIAGRAM: Visual representation of the <strong>AABA</strong> or <strong>ABABCB</strong> structure (Verse-Chorus-Bridge) used in popular song and songs from musicals, labeling the Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, and Outro sections].</li></ul>` }} />

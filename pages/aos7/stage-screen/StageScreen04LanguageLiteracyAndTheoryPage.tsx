<hr/>
<h2>4. Language, Literacy, and Theory: Area of Study 7 (Music for Stage and Screen)</h2>
<p>This area requires you to understand the language used to score Ballet, Film, and Computer Game Music (early 20th century to the present day).</p>
<h3>4.1. Specific Terminology: Genre-specific vocabulary</h3>
<p>You must apply sophisticated terminology to describe how music enhances the visual narrative and action.</p>
<div className="table-responsive"><table className="table table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Terminology Focus</th><th>Definition and Application</th><th>Source Citations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Narrative Devices</strong></td><td><strong>Leitmotif:</strong> A recurring musical theme associated with a specific character, idea, emotion, or scene, crucial for narrative development in film and stage music.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Rhythmic/Repetitive Devices</strong></td><td><strong>Ostinato:</strong> A repeated musical pattern used to build tension and rhythmic drive. <strong>Loops:</strong> Short, repeated patterns of music, fundamental to computer game scores.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Structural Tension</strong></td><td><strong>Breakdown, Build up, and Drop:</strong> Terms that originate in EDM (Area of Study 5) but describe the creation of intense tension followed by release, often used in film and game scores to punctuate action sequences.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Orchestral Colour</strong></td><td><strong>Fanfare:</strong> A short, ceremonial piece typically played by brass instruments, often used in film for heroism or majesty. <strong>Cluster chords:</strong> Groups of dissonant notes played together, often used in 20th-century ballet (like Stravinsky) or film to create harsh, unsettling textures.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game-Specific Terminology</strong></td><td><strong>Adaptive music:</strong> Music in computer games that changes dynamically based on player actions or location, ensuring a continuous but relevant musical experience.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Production/Effects</strong></td><td><strong>Sample, loop, chorus, reverb, delay, overdubbing, double-tracking, multi-tracking, drum machine:</strong> Techniques and devices essential for creating the full sound palette in both modern film/game scoring and recorded theatrical music.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

<h3>4.2. Lyrics &amp; Text Analysis: The study of the words, including their poetic structure, narrative, imagery, and symbolism.</h3>
<p>Since the focus of Area of Study 7 is on <strong>instrumental music</strong> (Ballet, Film, and Game scores) and how it accompanies visual action, direct analysis of lyrics is not generally applicable.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Focus on Programme:</strong> The analytical focus shifts to how the instrumental music functions as <strong>programme music</strong>, enhancing the extra-musical narrative, imagery, or dramatic action.</li><li> <strong>Narrative Technique:</strong> The primary method is analyzing how devices like the <strong>leitmotif</strong> (a melodic idea representing a character or feeling) are developed, transformed, or juxtaposed to convey narrative progression.</li><li> <strong>Emotional Imagery:</strong> You must analyze how musical elements—such as <strong>dissonance</strong> (for fear/conflict), <strong>chromaticism</strong> (for tension), or specific <strong>timbres</strong> (e.g., <em>pizzicato</em> strings for stealth)—are used to achieve the desired emotional and atmospheric <strong>word-painting</strong> effect on screen or stage.</li></ul>
<h3>4.3. Notation System: How music is recorded—staff notation, cipher, neumes, graphic scores, etc.</h3>
<p>Music for Stage and Screen relies heavily on the Western orchestral tradition, but modern computer game music often blends notation with digital tracking.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Staff Notation:</strong> Standard <strong>staff notation</strong> is essential for all orchestral scores (film and ballet). You must be able to read all rhythmic values, time signatures, clefs, and interpret common signs and symbols.</li><li> <strong>Transposing Instruments:</strong> Knowledge of <strong>transposing instruments</strong> is mandatory due to the use of the full symphony orchestra. You must understand transposition for <strong>trumpets in B flat, clarinets in B flat and A, and horns in F and E flat</strong>.</li></ul>
<ul><li>  [MUSIC SCORE: Excerpt from an orchestral score showing the written part for a <strong>Horn in F</strong> and the sounding pitch it would produce, illustrating the concept of transposition.]</li></ul>
<ul><li> <strong>Technology Commentary (Composition 2):</strong> When composing game or electronic music for Component 3, you may submit a <strong>written commentary</strong> instead of a full score. This commentary must be detailed, describing the music's structure and content, and explaining precisely "how your effects were achieved (e.g. through the use of... technology)" in the absence of written notation.</li></ul>
<h3>4.4. Oral/Aural Tradition: Transmission of music through listening and imitation rather than written form.</h3>
<p>While the music is extensively notated, aural skills (AO1) are critical for analysis, and technological and game music relies on a unique form of aural transmission.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Aural Recognition:</strong> The exam focuses entirely on your <strong>aural perception</strong> of complex musical events. You must be able to identify, purely by listening, when a <strong>leitmotif</strong> changes, when <strong>dissonance</strong> peaks, or what <strong>textures</strong> (like <strong>cluster chords</strong>) are used to match the action.</li><li> <strong>Adaptive Transmission:</strong> In computer game music, the musical output (soundtrack) often changes in real-time based on player input (<strong>adaptive music</strong>). This process is highly reliant on aural timing and programming rather than static score reading.</li></ul>
<h3>4.5. Music Theory Framework: The theoretical system underpinning the music</h3>
<p>The framework extends the Western tonal system to include the complex harmonic language of 20th and 21st-century composers.</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Tonality and Scales:</strong> You must recognize <strong>major and minor</strong> tonalities. However, the repertoire frequently utilizes <strong>chromaticism</strong> and <strong>dissonance</strong>. Twentieth-century works may use <strong>modal scales</strong> or the <strong>whole-tone scale</strong> for atmospheric effects.</li><li> <strong>Harmony:</strong> You must identify conventional Western harmony, including <strong>primary and secondary chords</strong>, <strong>dominant seventh</strong>, and <strong>diminished seventh</strong> chords. Crucially, you must recognize and describe <strong>dissonant</strong> and <strong>chromatic harmony</strong> used for dramatic effect.</li><li> <strong>Texture:</strong> You must recognize all major textures, including <strong>monophonic, homophonic, and polyphonic</strong>. For modern music, <strong>cluster chords</strong> are an essential texture term.</li><li> <strong>Devices:</strong> Mandatory devices used to create pace and tension include <strong>ostinato, repetition, ascending/descending sequence</strong>, and <strong>pedal notes</strong> (tonic and dominant pedal).</li></ul>` }} />

*Watch this performance of Handel's Concerto Grosso Op. 6 No. 5 to hear the interplay between the concertino and ripieno groups, and observe the characteristic Baroque style and ornamentation.*

## About Handel (1685–1759)

Born in Germany, Handel moved to England in 1712 and became one of the most celebrated Baroque composers. He is known for works in a wide variety of genres including operas, oratorios and concertos. His works show both German and Italian influences, creating a distinctive cosmopolitan style that made him hugely popular in London society.

## The Concerto Grosso Genre

The Baroque concerto grosso preceded the solo concerto and contrasts a group of soloists (known as the **concertino**) with the accompanying ensemble (referred to as the **ripieno** or **tutti**). A concerto grosso usually has four or more movements, sometimes including fugal writing, ternary, binary and ritornello form.

## Concerti Grossi Op. 6 (HWV 319–330)

Handel's set of 12 concerti grossi were written to be played during performances of his oratorios and other larger works and incorporate a wide variety of musical styles in the different movements. The music was composed during the autumn of 1739, but as was common in the Baroque era, Handel reused some material from earlier works in the concertos. The concertos follow the model of Corelli.

## Concerto Grosso in D major Op. 6, No. 5 (HWV 323)

### Instrumentation
This concerto is scored for:
- **Concertino**: Two solo violins and solo cello
- **Ripieno**: Strings and continuo
- **Additional**: Two oboes and bassoon (used only in some movements)

As in solo concertos, the soloists sometimes play with the ensemble and sometimes separately. Unlike Vivaldi's concerto, the solo lines are not particularly virtuosic, though the solo cello does play high enough to be notated in the tenor clef in some editions (in the Largo fourth movement).

### Movement 1: Larghetto e staccato

This first movement was based on the opening movement of Handel's overture for the *Ode to St Cecilia's Day*. It is in the style of a **Baroque French overture**, incorporating the stereotypical features including a slow, majestic opening section, with dotted rhythms, followed by a faster main section in fugal style (here this is the second movement).

**Key Features:**
- **Texture**: After an unusual monophonic opening from the concertino 1st violin, the two solo violinists play with the ripieno 1st violins while the solo cello doubles the bass line, giving a homophonic texture throughout
- **Melody**: Features many scalic passages and ornaments (trills are notated; other ornaments may be added in performance)
- **Harmony**: From the tonic key of D major modulates to the dominant (A major) at bar 16
- **Rhythm**: Dotted rhythms characteristic of French overture style. Bars 22–23 are a **hemiola**, where the notated two groups of three beats are felt as three groups of two beats
- **Cadences**: Bars 23–24 are a perfect cadence using the Ic-V-I progression and include an anticipation for the final note in the solo and 1st violins
- **Pedal**: Since the movement ends in A major, the pedal note heard in bars 19–21 is a dominant pedal (the note E)

### Movement 2: Allegro

This movement is the expected second part of the French overture, in **fugal style**.

**Structure and Texture:**
- **Subject**: The four-bar subject is introduced by the solo 1st ripieno 1st violins monophonically
- **Answer**: At bar 5 the solo and ripieno 2nd violins enter with the answer (the music of the subject repeated a fourth lower in the dominant) while the 1st violins play a countersubject, creating a two-part polyphonic texture
- **Development**: At bar 9 the solo cello and violas have the subject again, sometimes in unison, sometimes an octave apart with the violins playing polyphonically and the continuo playing a simplified version of the subject
- **Solo Sections**: At bar 15 the texture reduces to just soloists and continuo cello (Tasto solo indicates that the harpsichord does not play), taking bar 3 of the subject and playing it in imitation half a bar apart
- **Alternation**: This alternation of solo and tutti sections continues throughout the movement. At times the writing is more homophonic, with the violins playing in thirds over a bass line (e.g. bars 35–36)

**Musical Elements:**
- **Rhythm and Tempo**: Remains at the expected fast tempo throughout, which together with the fast-moving semiquavers and syncopation, drive the music forward
- **Tonality**: With the preceding movement ending in the dominant key of A major, this movement returns immediately to the tonic, but with frequent modulations to related keys, many to the dominant but also to E minor at bar 31, E major at bar 34 and B minor at bar 44
- **Harmony**: The mainly polyphonic texture keeps the movement flowing, but there are frequent perfect cadences and an imperfect cadence in bar 14. Examples of suspensions (e.g. 1st violin bars 18–20) and pedal notes (e.g. bar 14 onwards)
- **Melody**: Much of the melodic material is derived from the opening four-bar subject, which involves a great deal of stepwise movement. Although the treble melodies do not really feature sequences, there is a descending sequence in the bass in bars 11–12

### Movement 4: Largo

This slow movement includes the oboes and bassoon and alternates between solo and tutti passages.

**Key Features:**
- **Instrumentation**: In tutti passages the 1st and 2nd oboe and 1st and 2nd solo violins double the 1st and 2nd ripieno violins
- **Texture**: Frequent examples of imitation (e.g. bars 1–2 between the solo violins), giving a polyphonic texture, but also homophonic and monophonic textures (e.g. bars 14–16)
- **Rhythm**: In this triple time movement, there are examples of hemiola before most cadences
- **Character**: The generally descending line in the violins (in contrary motion with the bass) adds to the air of sadness created by the slower tempo and the minor key (the relative minor of B minor) and the use of suspensions
- **Ornamentation**: Trills are frequently indicated
- **Ending**: At the end of the movement there is striking use of silence. The movement ends with a **Phrygian cadence**: an imperfect cadence where the bass descends by a semitone. The two chords involved are IVb–V. This was common in Baroque movements in a minor key and linked one movement and the next

### Movement 6: Menuet – un poco larghetto

It is thought that this movement was added to the concerto just before publication.

**Characteristics:**
- **Form**: Exhibits many typical features of a minuet: triple time, a moderately fast tempo and sections which are repeated (though there are more than frequently found in such movements)
- **Instrumentation**: The wind are still present (both oboes doubling the 1st violins) and the key has returned to the tonic of D major
- **Texture**: It is tutti throughout, with no separate parts for the concertino
- **Dynamics**: Terraced dynamics are indicated in the score

## Performance Practice

In performances learners may notice that the dotted notes are played 'double dotted', as would have been done in the Baroque period. The notated dotted crotchet followed by a demisemiquaver rest also creates the idea of double dotting. Ornamentation is not always marked on the score and the fast tempo means that there is not always time to add it, but some performances may do soists – typically two violins and a cello) contrasting with the **ripieno** (the main orchestral body – strings and continuo).

**Overall Characteristics:**
*   **Key:** D major, a bright and often festive key in the Baroque, suitable for strings and often associated with trumpets (though none are used here).
*   **Instrumentation:**
    *   **Concertino:** Two solo violins, solo cello.
    *   **Ripieno:** String orchestra (violins I, violins II, viola) and Basso Continuo (harpsichord/organ, and cellos/double basses from the ripieno).
*   **Structure:** This concerto is unusual in Op. 6 for having six movements, though some are quite brief, creating a suite-like feel. The typical Baroque concerto had three. The syllabus focuses on movements 1, 2, 4, and 6.

**Movement Analysis (Syllabus Focus Movements):**

**1. Larghetto e staccato (D major)**
*   **Character:** The marking "Larghetto" indicates a fairly slow tempo, but "e staccato" (and detached) adds a crispness. It's an introductory movement, grand and stately, in the style of a French Overture's opening section (though not a full French Overture itself).
*   **Form:** Binary form (two repeated sections: ||: A :||: B :||), common for dance movements but here serving an introductory role.
*   **Features:**
    *   Dotted rhythms: Characteristic of French Overtures, giving a majestic feel.
    *   Homophonic texture: Largely chordal, emphasizing harmonic clarity.
    *   Use of suspensions and expressive harmonies.
    *   Clear cadences defining phrases.
    *   The "staccato" marking encourages a detached articulation.

**2. Allegro (D major)**
*   **Character:** A lively and energetic fugal movement.
*   **Form:** Fugue.
    *   **Subject:** A distinctive, rhythmically active theme introduced by one voice/part.
    *   **Answer:** The subject imitated in another voice, typically in the dominant key.
    *   **Countersubject:** A secondary melodic idea that often accompanies the subject or answer.
    *   **Episodes:** Sections where the subject is absent, often modulatory and using fragments of the subject or countersubject, or new material.
    *   **Stretto:** Overlapping entries of the subject.
*   **Features:**
    *   Polyphonic texture: Multiple independent melodic lines interweaving.
    *   Strong rhythmic drive.
    *   Sequential passages in episodes.
    *   Clear articulation.

**4. Largo (B minor – relative minor of D major)**
*   **Character:** A slow, expressive, and lyrical movement, providing contrast to the surrounding faster movements.
*   **Key:** B minor, the relative minor of D major, creates a more introspective and poignant mood.
*   **Form:** Often through-composed or a simple binary/ternary structure, focusing on melodic development.
*   **Features:**
    *   Melody often in the solo violin(s) of the concertino.
    *   Rich harmonies and use of suspensions for emotional effect.
    *   Sustained lines and a slow, walking bass create a solemn atmosphere.

**6. Menuet (D major)**
*   **Character:** An elegant and graceful dance in triple meter.
*   **Form:** A simple binary form (||: A :||: B :||), typical for a minuet.
*   **Features:**
    *   Clear, balanced phrases.
    *   Homophonic texture.
    *   The movement provides a light and courtly conclusion to the concerto.`,

## The Foundation of Popular Music

Harmony provides the emotional and structural foundation for popular songs. It influences mood, supports melody, and guides the listener's emotional journey through the song. Understanding harmony is essential for creating compelling popular music.

## Understanding Chord Construction

### Basic Triads

**Major Triads**
- **Construction**: Root, Major 3rd, Perfect 5th
- **Sound**: Bright, happy, stable
- **Examples**: C major (C-E-G), F major (F-A-C)
- **Usage**: Often used for uplifting, positive sections

**Minor Triads**
- **Construction**: Root, Minor 3rd, Perfect 5th
- **Sound**: Sad, mysterious, introspective
- **Examples**: A minor (A-C-E), D minor (D-F-A)
- **Usage**: Emotional depth, melancholy, introspection

**Diminished Triads**
- **Construction**: Root, Minor 3rd, Diminished 5th
- **Sound**: Tense, unstable, dramatic
- **Usage**: Transition chords, creating tension

**Augmented Triads**
- **Construction**: Root, Major 3rd, Augmented 5th
- **Sound**: Mysterious, floating, unresolved
- **Usage**: Special effects, jazz-influenced sections

### Seventh Chords

**Dominant Seventh (V7)**
- **Construction**: Major triad + Minor 7th
- **Function**: Creates strong pull to resolution
- **Examples**: G7 (G-B-D-F) resolving to C
- **Usage**: Blues, rock, creating harmonic tension

**Major Seventh (Maj7)**
- **Construction**: Major triad + Major 7th
- **Sound**: Sophisticated, dreamy, jazzy
- **Examples**: Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B)
- **Usage**: Ballads, sophisticated pop, R&B

**Minor Seventh (m7)**
- **Construction**: Minor triad + Minor 7th
- **Sound**: Smooth, mellow, sophisticated
- **Examples**: Am7 (A-C-E-G)
- **Usage**: Smooth transitions, R&B, neo-soul

## Key Centers and Relationships

### Major Key Harmony

**Diatonic Chords in Major Keys:**
- **I**: Major (tonic - home base)
- **ii**: Minor (subdominant function)
- **iii**: Minor (tonic function, less common)
- **IV**: Major (subdominant - departure from home)
- **V**: Major (dominant - wants to return home)
- **vi**: Minor (relative minor, tonic function)
- **vii°**: Diminished (dominant function, rarely used)

**Functional Harmony:**
- **Tonic (I, vi)**: Stability, home, rest
- **Subdominant (IV, ii)**: Departure, movement away
- **Dominant (V, vii°)**: Tension, wants to resolve to tonic

### Minor Key Harmony

**Natural Minor Chords:**
- **i**: Minor (tonic)
- **ii°**: Diminished
- **III**: Major (relative major)
- **iv**: Minor
- **v**: Minor (often changed to major V)
- **VI**: Major
- **VII**: Major

**Harmonic Minor Considerations:**
- **V chord becomes major**: Creates stronger resolution
- **Leading tone**: Pulls strongly to tonic
- **Augmented 2nd interval**: Between VI and VII creates exotic sound

- Instead resolves to relative minor
- Creates surprise and emotional impact
- Extends harmonic journey

**Usage in Popular Music:**
- Extends choruses
- Creates emotional twists
- Delays final resolution
- Adds sophistication

### Modal Interchange

**Borrowing from Parallel Modes:**
- Use chords from parallel major/minor

## The Pulse of Popular Music

Rhythm is the heartbeat of popular music. It provides the foundation that everything else builds upon - melody, harmony, and lyrics all depend on a strong rhythmic framework. Understanding rhythm is crucial for creating music that moves people both emotionally and physically.

## Fundamental Rhythm Concepts

### Definition of Rhythm

Rhythm encompasses several interconnected elements:
- **The cadence of words**: How lyrics flow rhythmically
- **Meter of musical phrasing**: The underlying pulse and organization
- **Underlying groove**: The feel that makes people want to move

### Beat and Pulse

**The Beat:**
- The basic unit of time in music
- What you tap your foot to
- Provides the reference point for all other rhythmic elements
- Usually corresponds to the quarter note in popular music

**Strong and Weak Beats:**
- **Strong beats**: 1 and 3 in 4/4 time
- **Weak beats**: 2 and 4 in 4/4 time

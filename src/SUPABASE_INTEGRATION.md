## Usage

### Authentication
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../contexts/AuthContext'

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, signIn, signOut } = useAuth()
  
  // Check if user is authenticated
  if (user) {
    return <button onClick={() => signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
  }
  
  // Use LoginForm component or handle sign-in manually
  return <LoginForm />
}
```

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
import { ProgressService } from '../services/progressService'

// Save quiz progress
await ProgressService.saveQuizProgress(
  userId,
  'section_name',
  'quiz_id',
  score,
  totalQuestions,
  timeTaken
)

// Get user progress
const progress = await ProgressService.getUserProgress(userId)
```

### Real-time Updates
```typescript
import { RealtimeService } from '../services/realtimeService'

// Subscribe to changes
const subscription = RealtimeService.subscribeToProgress((payload) => {
  console.log('Change received:', payload)
  // Update UI
})

// Unsubscribe when component unmounts
RealtimeService.unsubscribe(subscription)
```

### File Storage
```typescript
import { StorageService } from '../services/storageService'

// Upload profile image
await StorageService.uploadProfileImage(userId, file)

// Get profile image URL
const imageUrl = StorageService.getProfileImageUrl(userId)
```

### Teacher Dashboard
```typescript
import { TeacherService } from '../services/teacherService'

// Get all student progress (teachers/admins only)
const progress = await TeacherService.getAllStudentProgress()

// Get progress for a specific student
const studentProgress = await TeacherService.getStudentProgress(studentId)
```

## Next Steps
1. Implement UI components for authentication flows
2. Create teacher dashboard interface
3. Add profile management screens
4. Implement file upload components
5. Add real-time progress visualization
